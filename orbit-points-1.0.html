        <div><p>After 10 months of being unable to come up with anything interesting to post on the blog, I realized
it might be a good idea use this blog to keep track of the math I've been working on. That way my blog
can act as a public version of my research notebook, and be a good place to relearn this material if I
happen to forget the details in the future.</p>
<p>I have been learning some Patterson-Sullivan theory for the past few weeks with the goal of using the
theory to solve some counting problems. To be more precise, I'm working with the following setup.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(X\)</span> is an unbounded metric space (in practice, <span class="math">\(X\)</span> is usually <span class="math">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\mathbb{H}^n\)</span>, or
      <span class="math">\(\mathcal{T}_{g}\)</span> (the Teichmüller space of genus <span class="math">\(g\)</span> surfaces)).</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span> is a discrete group acting on <span class="math">\(X\)</span> via isometries.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given a point <span class="math">\(x \in X\)</span>, and a radius <span class="math">\(r\)</span>, I'm interested in knowing how many points of the orbit of
<span class="math">\(x\)</span> under <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span>, which we'll denote <span class="math">\(\Gamma x\)</span>, lie in a ball of radius <span class="math">\(r\)</span> about <span class="math">\(x\)</span> (which
we'll denote by <span class="math">\(B(x, r)\)</span>). Since we're dealing with a discrete group, the number of orbit points
clearly won't be a continuous function of <span class="math">\(r\)</span>, which means we can't expect a nice exact answer, but
we can ask questions about the asymptotics of the orbit counting function.</p>
<p>It's instructive to start off with the simplest example: our metric space is <span class="math">\(\mathbb{R}^2\)</span>, and our
discrete group <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span> is just the group generated by translations by <span class="math">\((0,1)\)</span> and <span class="math">\((1,0)\)</span>. If we
pick <span class="math">\(x\)</span> to be the point <span class="math">\((0.5,0.5)\)</span> (we're picking this point so our pictures look nicer), our
orbit counting question translates to the following question: How many half-integer points does a ball of
radius <span class="math">\(r\)</span> contain? A way to answer this question is to think of the fundamental domain of the group
<span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span>. If the ball contains <span class="math">\(n\)</span> points, we might expect it to contain <span class="math">\(n\)</span> copies of the fundamental domain,
which means we'd expect it have <span class="math">\(n\)</span> times the area of a fundamental domain. That's not quite correct, as the following
picture demonstrates.</p>
<table class="image">
<caption align="bottom">Figure 1: The black orbit points have their fundamental domains completely in the ball, whereas the red ones don't. The ball also
has parts of fundamental domains for which it doesn't contain the corresponding orbit point.</caption>
<tr><td><img src="../images/orbit-points-1/fig1.png" width="70%" height="auto" class="center"/></td></tr>
</table>

<p>However, since the fundamental domain has diameter bounded by <span class="math">\(1\)</span>, we can expand and contract our ball slightly to get
upper and lower bounds in terms of area. If we denote the number of orbit points in a ball of radius <span class="math">\(r\)</span> as <span class="math">\(C(r)\)</span>,
we get the following inequality for <span class="math">\(C(r)\)</span>.
</p>
<div class="math">$$
\frac{\text{Area}(B(x, r-1))}{\text{Area}(\text{Fundamental domain})} \leq C(r) \leq \frac{\text{Area}(B(x, r+1))}{\text{Area}(\text{Fundamental domain})}
$$</div>
<p>Note now for large values of <span class="math">\(r\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\text{Area}(x, r-1)\)</span> is approximately equal to <span class="math">\(\text{Area}(x,
r+1)\)</span>, i.e. their ratio approaches <span class="math">\(0\)</span>. That means for large values of <span class="math">\(r\)</span>, <span class="math">\(C(r)\)</span> behaves like
<span class="math">\(\frac{\text{Area}(B(x, r+1))}{\text{Area}(\text{Fundamental domain})}\)</span>. This only works out because
<span class="math">\(\frac{(r+1)^2}{(r-1)^2}\)</span> approaches <span class="math">\(1\)</span> as <span class="math">\(r\)</span> gets larger.</p>
<p>The result in the case of <span class="math">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> suggests what the answer should be even in the more general
cases, at least when the discrete group <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span> has a fundamental domain with finite volume,
i.e. when <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(discrete_subgroup)">lattice</a>. In the
case when one is working in <span class="math">\(\mathbb{H}^n\)</span>, the asymptotics are the same.  </p>
<div class="math">$$ C(r) \sim
\frac{\text{Area}(B(x, r))}{\text{Area}(\text{Fundamental domain})} $$</div>
<p> One might try the same proof
as before, and it almost works except that it fails at a rather critical step.  Recall that the
volume of a ball of radius <span class="math">\(r\)</span> in <span class="math">\(\mathbb{H}^n\)</span> is not polynomial in <span class="math">\(r\)</span>, but rather exponential.
To be more specific, the volume is proportional to <span class="math">\(e^r\)</span>, which means the following ratio
does not converge to <span class="math">\(1\)</span>.
</p>
<div class="math">$$
\frac{\text{Area}(x, r+1)}{\text{Area}(x, r-1)}
$$</div>
<p>
To be more precise, the thing that can go wrong is the following: by estimating the number of lattice points
as <span class="math">\(c \cdot \text{Area}(B(x,r))\)</span> (where <span class="math">\(c = \frac{1}{\text{Area}(\text{Fundamental domain})}\)</span>), we may
drastically over count or under count, as the following pictures illustrate.</p>
<table class="image">
<caption align="bottom">Figure 2: This is an underestimate because even though the blue orbit points are in the ball,
most of their fundamental domains aren't, which leads to an underestimate by the area calculation/</caption>
<tr><td><img src="../images/orbit-points-1/under_estimate.png" width="70%" height="auto" class="center"/></td></tr>
</table>

<table class="image">
<caption align="bottom">Figure 3: This is an overestimate because even though the blue orbit points are outside the ball,
most of their fundamental domains are in the ball, which leads to an overestimate by the area calculation/</caption>
<tr><td><img src="../images/orbit-points-1/over_estimate.png" width="70%" height="auto" class="center"/></td></tr>
</table>

<p>However, these are the worst case scenarios. In a more realistic scenario, one might expect the
overestimates and underestimates to cancel out as the ball gets larger and larger. One might expect
that to happen if the direction at which the boundary of the ball approaches translates of the
fundamental domain is approximately random, and independent of the directions it approaches other
translates by. That turns out to be true, and is a consequence of the fact that the geodesic flow on
hyperbolic surfaces of finite volume is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixing_(mathematics)#Mixing_in_dynamical_systems">mixing</a>.
This intuition is formalized in the following lemma from a paper by Eskin and McMullen<sup id="fnref:paper1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:paper1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p><strong>Lemma:</strong> Let <span class="math">\(X = \Gamma/\mathbb{H}^2\)</span> be a finite volume hyperbolic surface, and <span class="math">\(S(p, r)\)</span> be the image
of a sphere of radius <span class="math">\(r\)</span> on <span class="math">\(\mathbb{H}^2\)</span> with centre a lift of a point <span class="math">\(p\)</span> in <span class="math">\(\Gamma/\mathbb{H}^2\)</span>.
Then for any compactly supported continuous function <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span>, the average of <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> over <span class="math">\(S(p, r)\)</span> (with
respect to the Lebesgue measure on <span class="math">\(S^1\)</span>) approaches the average of <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> over <span class="math">\(X\)</span> as
<span class="math">\(r\)</span> approaches <span class="math">\(\infty\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong> To prove this result, we need to lift the function <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> to the unit tangent bundle
<span class="math">\(T^1X\)</span>, and we do that in the obvious way, i.e. <span class="math">\({\alpha}(x, v) = \alpha(x)\)</span>, for any unit tangent
vector <span class="math">\(v\)</span> over <span class="math">\(x\)</span>. Also, let <span class="math">\(K\)</span> be the set of all vectors over <span class="math">\(p\)</span>. Then the image of <span class="math">\(K\)</span> under
the geodesic flow <span class="math">\(g_t\)</span> is the collection of vectors over <span class="math">\(S(p, t)\)</span> pointing normally outwards. In
particular, the average of <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> over <span class="math">\(S(p, t)\)</span> is the same as the average of <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> over
<span class="math">\(g_t(K)\)</span><sup id="fnref:observation"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:observation">2</a></sup>. Furthermore, <span class="math">\(g_t(K)\)</span> can be approximated arbitrarily well by <span class="math">\(g_t(U)\)</span> where
<span class="math">\(U\)</span> is the collection of vectors over a small neighbourhood of <span class="math">\(p\)</span>. Because the geodesic flow is
mixing, the average of <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> over <span class="math">\(g_t(U)\)</span> approaches the average of <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> over <span class="math">\(S^1X\)</span> (and
equivalently, <span class="math">\(X\)</span>), as <span class="math">\(t\)</span> approaches <span class="math">\(\infty\)</span>. This proves the result. <span class="math">\(\square\)</span></p>
<p>Once we have the lemma, the rest is smooth sailing. We let <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> be a bump function supported in
a small neighbourhood of <span class="math">\(p\)</span>, and lift <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> to a function <span class="math">\(\widetilde{\alpha}\)</span> on the universal
cover. To count the number of orbit points in a ball of radius <span class="math">\(r\)</span>, we just integrate
<span class="math">\(\widetilde{\alpha}\)</span> on that ball. We can approximate this integral for large <span class="math">\(r\)</span> using the lemma we
just proved, and that gives us the estimate we want, namely that the number of orbit points in a
ball of radius <span class="math">\(r\)</span> is asymptotically <span class="math">\(\frac{\text{Area}(B(p, r))}{\text{Area}(\text{Fundamental
Domain})}\)</span>.</p>
<p>One of the key elements of this proof was the fact that the geodesic flow is mixing with respect to
a suitable measure. That suggests how one might extend this idea to other contexts. One important
generalization of cocompact lattices are convex cocompact groups<sup id="fnref:convex"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:convex">3</a></sup>. And for these groups, the
estimates we have here don't work verbatim because the fundamental domain for a convex cocompact
group may not have finite area. Secondly, the lemma as stated won't work either because the
Liouville measure is not the "correct" measure on the unit tangent bundle. Not only is it not
mixing, it's not even preserved by geodesic flow. In fact, the geodesic flow makes all the
mass of Liouville measure escape the convex core, which means that one cannot do dynamics on a convex cocompact
group using the Liouville measure. The right measure for this context turns out to be the Bowen-Margulis measure,
which is constructed using the Patterson-Sullivan measure on the boundary, and that is what I will write about in
my next blog post.</p>

<p>The fact is fairly obvious in this case because the measure on <span class="math">\(S^1X\)</span> is the
Liouville measure, which is locally a product of the Riemannian measure on the base, and
Lebesgue measure on the fibre. However, this fact is no longer obvious if one is dealing with
other measures like the Bowen-Margulis measure, which may not be uniform in every direction.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:observation" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
