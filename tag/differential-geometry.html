        <div><p>I'm almost a week into the algebraic geometry workshop now, and I've learnt a
lot.  I've learnt a few things about varieties, and also a bit of commutative
algebra, but the most important takeaway for me from the first week was the
sheaf theoretic way of looking at smooth manifolds (and also algebraic
varieties). I'll talk a bit about this approach of looking at things, and then
outline a definition of cotangent space using this formalism, and see how that
lets us define a cotangent space on algebraic varieties. Finally, we'll have some sanity
checks on the defined cotangent space to see if some properties carry over to
the category of algebraic varieties.</p>
<h2>The sheaf of regular functions on a topological space</h2>
<p>Let's consider a specific example: consider some smooth manifold <span class="math">\(M\)</span>. For any
open subset <span class="math">\(U\)</span>, consider the set <span class="math">\(\mathcal{O}(U)\)</span> of all smooth functions from
<span class="math">\(U\)</span> to <span class="math">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>.  We have such a collection for each open subset of <span class="math">\(M\)</span>. But
that's not all - we have relations between the various <span class="math">\(\mathcal{O}(U)\)</span>. If <span class="math">\(U
\subset V\)</span>, then there's a natural map from <span class="math">\(\mathcal{O}(V)\)</span> to
<span class="math">\(\mathcal{O}(U)\)</span>, which is the restriction map. Now recall that we are working
with smooth functions: one property of smoothness is that it's a local
property. To put it more concretely, if we have <em>any</em> map from an open set <span class="math">\(U\)</span>
to <span class="math">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> such that its restriction to each open subset <span class="math">\(U_i\)</span> is smooth,
where <span class="math">\(\{U_i\}\)</span> is some collection of open subsets that covers <span class="math">\(U\)</span>, then we know
that <span class="math">\(U\)</span> is actually smooth. Phrasing this in terms of the <span class="math">\(\mathcal{O}(U)\)</span>
formalism, it just means that if the restriction of a function <span class="math">\(f\)</span> to each <span class="math">\(U_i\)</span>
is contained in <span class="math">\(\mathcal{O}(U_i)\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is actually in <span class="math">\(\mathcal{O}(U)\)</span>.</p>
<p>These two properties make the collection <span class="math">\(\{\mathcal{O}(U)\}\)</span> into
a sheaf. Furthermore, the set <span class="math">\(\mathcal{O}(U)\)</span> can be given the structure
of an algebra, because the maps are all into a ring, and hence the functions can
be added and multiplied pointwise, and multiplied by elements of the ring
<span class="math">\(R\)</span>. And if we vary the space <span class="math">\(X\)</span>, the ring <span class="math">\(R\)</span>, and the sets <span class="math">\(\mathcal{O}(U)\)</span>,
we end up getting various familiar spaces and maps. For instance, if we keep <span class="math">\(X\)</span>
as a manifold, and <span class="math">\(R\)</span> as <span class="math">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>, but require <span class="math">\(\mathcal{O}(U)\)</span> to the
collection of <span class="math">\(C^1\)</span> functions, we end up getting a <span class="math">\(C^1\)</span> manifold. If we set <span class="math">\(X\)</span>
as a some affine variety over a field <span class="math">\(k\)</span>, set <span class="math">\(R\)</span> as <span class="math">\(k\)</span>, and set
<span class="math">\(\mathcal{O}(U)\)</span> as the ratio of polynomials where the denominator does not
vanish on the set <span class="math">\(U\)</span>, we get the regular functions of affine varieties.</p>
<p>Sheaves are a nice way of capturing functions which satisfy some property
<em>locally</em>, whether it is being smooth, being holomorphic, or being ratios of
polynomials.</p>
<h2>Sheaves capture local properties</h2>
<p>Consider a topological space <span class="math">\(X\)</span> and the sheaf of regular functions
<span class="math">\(\mathcal{O}\)</span> to a field <span class="math">\(k\)</span>, and some point <span class="math">\(p \in X\)</span>.  With the sheaves, we
have a way of looking at the <em>germ</em> of any function <span class="math">\(f\)</span> at the point <span class="math">\(p\)</span>.  It's
clear that the germ of <span class="math">\(f\)</span> will capture all the local information of <span class="math">\(f\)</span> at that
point.  For instance, when the regular functions are smooth functions, the germ
of <span class="math">\(f\)</span> will contain the information about all the derivatives of <span class="math">\(f\)</span>. If the
regular functions are holomorphic functions, the germ contains even <em>global</em>
information about the function because of analytic continuation.  The collection
of the germs of all the functions defined around <span class="math">\(p\)</span>, called the stalk at <span class="math">\(p\)</span>, is
again a <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-algebra. It is much more, in fact. It's a local ring (which we'll
call <span class="math">\(\mathcal{O}_p\)</span>), whose only maximal ideal is the set of germs of all the functions
which vanish at <span class="math">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<p>Another way of getting local information at the point <span class="math">\(p\)</span> is to look at tangent vectors
at the point <span class="math">\(p\)</span>. What do tangent vectors mean in this context though? A tangent vector
<span class="math">\(v\)</span> at <span class="math">\(p\)</span> is a <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-linear map from the set of all functions defined in some open set
around <span class="math">\(p\)</span> to <span class="math">\(k\)</span> such that for any two functions <span class="math">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math">\(g\)</span>, the
product rule holds.
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align*}
v(fg) = f(p) \cdot v(g) + v(f) \cdot g(p)
\end{align*}</div>
<p>
It's not quite clear from the definition whether the action of the tangent vector
on a function <span class="math">\(f\)</span> depends only the germ of <span class="math">\(f\)</span>. In fact, even the relation between
the tangent space, and the local ring at <span class="math">\(p\)</span> is not very clear from this definition.
We need some way to link the two notions. And that's where the cotangent space comes
in. We shall define the cotangent space in purely algebraic terms, i.e. in terms of the
local ring, and then show that the space of tangent vectors <span class="math">\(T_p\)</span> is actually the dual of
the cotangent space, thus exhibiting the link between the local ring at <span class="math">\(p\)</span>, to the
tangent space at <span class="math">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<h3>Construction of the algebraic cotangent space</h3>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(\mathfrak{m}\)</span> be the maximal ideal of <span class="math">\(\mathcal{O}_p\)</span>. It consists of the
germs of all the functions which vanish at <span class="math">\(p\)</span>. We define the cotangent space at
<span class="math">\(p\)</span> to be the set <span class="math">\(\frac{\mathfrak{m}}{\mathfrak{m}^2}\)</span> considered as a <span class="math">\(k\)</span>
vector space. I won't outline the motivation behind picking this as the
cotangent space, because I myself am not completely sure why, so let's take for
granted that this is a reasonable candidate for the definition of cotangent
space. We need to show that <span class="math">\(T_p\)</span> is the dual of the space
<span class="math">\(\frac{\mathfrak{m}}{\mathfrak{m}^2}\)</span>.</p>
<p>First we'll show every element of <span class="math">\(T_p\)</span> is indeed a linear functional acting on
<span class="math">\(\frac{\mathfrak{m}}{\mathfrak{m}^2}\)</span>. Take any element <span class="math">\(v \in T_p\)</span>. It acts
on an element <span class="math">\(m + \mathfrak{m}^2\)</span>, and returns <span class="math">\(v(m)\)</span>. This map is well defined,
because for any other representative <span class="math">\(m'\)</span>, <span class="math">\(m - m' \in \mathfrak{m}^2\)</span>, i.e. it is
of the form <span class="math">\(m_1 m_2\)</span> for <span class="math">\(m_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(m_2\)</span> in <span class="math">\(\mathfrak{m}\)</span>. Using the identity
for tangent vectors, <span class="math">\(v(m_1m_2)\)</span> is given by <span class="math">\(m_1(p)v(m_2) + v(m_1)m_2(p)\)</span>, and
both the terms are <span class="math">\(0\)</span>, since elements of <span class="math">\(\mathfrak{m}\)</span> evaluate to <span class="math">\(0\)</span> at <span class="math">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now we'll show any linear functional <span class="math">\(w\)</span> acting on
<span class="math">\(\frac{\mathfrak{m}}{\mathfrak{m}^2}\)</span> gives a tangent vector <span class="math">\(t_w\)</span>. We define
the action of <span class="math">\(t_w\)</span> on any function <span class="math">\(f\)</span> as the value of the functional <span class="math">\(w\)</span> on
the function <span class="math">\(\overline{f}(x) = f(x) - f(p)\)</span>. The function <span class="math">\(\overline{f}\)</span> vanishes at <span class="math">\(0\)</span>, and hence it
belongs to <span class="math">\(\mathfrak{m}\)</span>. All we need to do is check whether it satisfies the
product rule.
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align*}
t_w(f(x)g(x)) &amp;= w(\overline{f(x)g(x)}) \\
&amp;= w(f(x)g(x) - f(p)g(p)) \\
&amp;= w(f(x)g(x) - f(x)g(p) + f(x)g(p) - f(p)g(p)) \\
&amp;= w(f(x)(g(x) - g(p))) + g(p) w(f(x) - f(p)) \\
&amp;= w((f(x) - f(p))(g(x) - g(p)) + f(p)(g(x) - g(p))) + g(p) w(f(x) - f(p)) \\
&amp;= 0 + f(p)t_w(g) + t_w(f)g(p)
\end{align*}</div>
<p>This proves the duality, and gives us a link between the tangent space and the local ring.
In the case of smooth manifolds, this tells us that the cotangent space defined using the local
ring is really the same as the cotangent space defined in the usual differential geometric way.
What isn't immediately clear is how the cotangent bundle is defined, and this is something I'll
come back to later. The advantage of this construction is that the same construction goes through
for algebraic varieties. Whether this is a useful notion or not in the case of algebraic varieties
is a question that needs to be answered. But before that, we should do a sanity check. In the case
of smooth manifolds, we had the dimension of the cotangent space at every point to be the dimension
of the manifold. It's reasonable to expect that this also happens in the case of algebraic manifolds.
And that is indeed the case, and we'll see a simple proof of the fact.</p>
<h3>Dimension of cotangent space is the same as the dimension of algebraic variety</h3>
<p>Before we prove the result, let's qualify the statement a little more. First of
all, it suffices to prove the result for affine varieties, since both the
cotangent space and the dimension of the variety are essentially local
properties. Secondly, varieties can have bad points, i.e. singularities, where
they intersect themselves, or there's a sharp bend of some sort (e.g. the
variety in <span class="math">\(\mathbb{A}^2_{\mathbb{C}}\)</span> defined by <span class="math">\(X^3 - Y^2\)</span>). We want to avoid
those points. Thankfully, there's a nice algebraic description of the
non-singular points. A point <span class="math">\(p\)</span> is non-singular if the local ring
<span class="math">\(\mathcal{O}_p\)</span> at <span class="math">\(p\)</span> is regular, i.e. the maximal ideal is generated by <span class="math">\(d\)</span>
elements, where <span class="math">\(d\)</span> is the dimension of the variety. With this algebraic description in hand,
our task now reduces to proving the following proposition.</p>
<p><strong>Proposition.</strong> Suppose <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is a Noetherian <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-algebra, which is also a local ring whose
maximal ideal <span class="math">\(\mathfrak{m}\)</span> is generated by <span class="math">\(d\)</span> elements <span class="math">\(\{f_1, \ldots, f_d\}\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(d\)</span>
is the Krull dimension of the <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-algebra. Then the dimension of the <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-vector space
<span class="math">\(\frac{\mathfrak{m}}{\mathfrak{m}^2}\)</span> is also <span class="math">\(d\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Consider any element <span class="math">\(g\)</span> in the ideal <span class="math">\(\mathfrak{m}\)</span>. Since it's Noetherian and local, we can
write <span class="math">\(g\)</span> in the following manner,
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align*}
g = \sum_j c_j (f_1)^{p_{1j}} \cdots (f_d)^{p_{dj}}
\end{align*}</div>
<p>
where <span class="math">\(c_j\)</span> don't belong to the ideal <span class="math">\(\mathfrak{m}\)</span>, and for all <span class="math">\(j\)</span>, some <span class="math">\(p_{ij}\)</span> some greater
than <span class="math">\(0\)</span>. Quotienting by <span class="math">\(\mathfrak{m}^2\)</span>, all the terms with the higher powers of <span class="math">\(f_i\)</span> become <span class="math">\(0\)</span>,
and the representative in the quotient looks like the following.
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align*}
\overline{g} = \sum_{i}^{d} c_i f_i
\end{align*}</div>
<p>
With this expression, it's easy to see what the map to the space <span class="math">\(k^d\)</span> is. Send <span class="math">\(\overline{g}\)</span> to the vector
<span class="math">\((c_1(p), c_2(p), \ldots, c_d(p))\)</span>. But is this map well defined? What if we also have another
representative <span class="math">\(\overline{g}' = \sum c_i'f_i\)</span>. But in that case, each of <span class="math">\(c_i - c_i'\)</span> must belong
to <span class="math">\(\mathfrak{m}\)</span>, hence <span class="math">\(c_i(p) = c_i'(p)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let's now construct a map from <span class="math">\(k^d\)</span> to <span class="math">\(\frac{\mathfrak{m}}{\mathfrak{m}^2}\)</span>. Send the vector
<span class="math">\((c_1, \ldots, c_d)\)</span> to the element <span class="math">\(\sum c_i f_i\)</span>. It's easy to see this map is well defined,
and the inverse of the previous map. This proves the result.
<span class="math">\(\blacksquare\)</span></p>
<p>The cotangent space manages to pass at least this rudimentary sanity check, which makes it a little easier
to believe that this is the right notion of the cotangent space on a variety.</p>
