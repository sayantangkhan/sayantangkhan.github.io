        </div>
        
        <div><p>One of the things a math major learns in their first proof based course is that one must
prove existence of objects before going on to prove any properties about them. After a few years,
this becomes almost second nature, and most pure mathematicians are wary of making claims about any
object without first proving its existence. In practice, physicists and applied mathematicians
aren't held back by such restrictions: they often assume the existence of, say, a solution to a PDE,
and prove results about the solutions, e.g. prove bounds on the size, smoothness, etc. and it often
turns out that the solutions do exist, and satisfy those properties. A priori estimates are the
bounds on the solution one gets before one actually knows the solution exists. Under certain conditions,
one can then use these bounds on the solution to show that a solution exists. Informally, the chain of
logic looks something like the following.
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align*}
(\text{Solution exists} \implies \text{Solution bounded by } C ) \implies \text{Solution exists}
\end{align*}</div>
<p>
The first implication is the a priori estimate, and the second implication follows from a general
fixed point theorem. We'll see how it works out in practice, but before we see a real example, we'll
see a pseudo-example from algebra which looks similar to an a priori estimate.</p>
<h3>Normality is local</h3>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(R\)</span> be a normal ring. This means that <span class="math">\(R\)</span> is an integral domain such that for any <span class="math">\(\theta \in \text{Frac}(R)\)</span>,
if <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> is a root of a monic polynomial in <span class="math">\(R[x]\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> actually belongs to <span class="math">\(R\)</span>. We want to prove
the following result.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> If <span class="math">\(R\)</span> is a normal ring, and <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is a non-zero element of <span class="math">\(R\)</span>, then the localization <span class="math">\(f^{-1}R\)</span>
is also normal.</p>
<p>Suppose <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> is some element in <span class="math">\(\text{Frac}(f^{-1}R)\)</span> which satisfies a monic polynomial
in <span class="math">\(f^{-1}R[x]\)</span>. Notice that <span class="math">\(\text{Frac}(f^{-1}R) = \text{Frac}(R)\)</span>, so <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> can be thought
of belonging to <span class="math">\(\text{Frac}(R)\)</span>. Elements of <span class="math">\(f^{-1}R\)</span> are of the form <span class="math">\(\frac{r}{f^k}\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(r \in R\)</span>,
and we can also assume <span class="math">\(k\)</span> is the minimal exponent, i.e. <span class="math">\(r\)</span> is not a multiple of <span class="math">\(f\)</span> in <span class="math">\(R\)</span>. One can think
of the exponent <span class="math">\(k\)</span> as a kind of norm on elements of <span class="math">\(f^{-1}R\)</span>. Let <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> be a root of the following
monic polynomial.
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align*}
x^n + \frac{r_{n-1}}{f^{k_{n-1}}}x^{n-1} + \cdots + \frac{r_{1}}{f^{k_{1}}}x + \frac{r_{0}}{f^{k_{0}}}
\end{align*}</div>
<p>
We need to show that this equation has a solution in <span class="math">\(f^{-1}R\)</span>, in particular, <span class="math">\(\theta \in f^{-1}\)</span>.
In the spirit of a priori estimates, let's assume that <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> is a solution that actually lies
in <span class="math">\(f^{-1}R\)</span>. We'll try to get a bound on the norm of <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span>, i.e. an a priori estimate. Let <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span>
be of the form <span class="math">\(\frac{\alpha}{f^k}\)</span>. We want to plug <span class="math">\(\frac{\alpha}{f^k}\)</span> into the given polynomial and get
a monic polynomial in <span class="math">\(R[\alpha]\)</span>, since <span class="math">\(R\)</span> is normal. If we plug in <span class="math">\(\frac{\alpha}{f^k}\)</span>, we get the following.
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align*}
    \frac{1}{f^{nk}}\alpha^{n} + \frac{r_{n-1}}{f^{k_{n-1} +nk - k}} \alpha^{n-1} +
    \frac{r_{n-2}}{f^{k_{n-2} +nk - 2k}} \alpha^{n-2} + \cdots +  \frac{r_{1}}{f^{k_{1} +nk - (n-1)k}} \alpha^{1} +
    \frac{r_0}{f^{k_0}} = 0
\end{align*}</div>
<p>
If we want to clear denominators, and still retain a monic polynomial, our <span class="math">\(k\)</span> must satisfy the following inequalities
for all <span class="math">\(1 \leq j \leq n\)</span>.
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align*}
    k \geq \frac{k_{n-j}}{j}
\end{align*}</div>
<p>
These inequalities are our a priori estimates. We assumed that the solution existed, and we then bounded its norm below
by a fixed quantity. Now we need to show that this implies a solution exists. Notice that after clearing the denominator,
we get a monic polynomial in <span class="math">\(R[x]\)</span> which is satisfies by <span class="math">\(\alpha = f^k \theta\)</span> which belongs to <span class="math">\(\text{Frac}(R)\)</span>. Since
<span class="math">\(R\)</span> is normal, <span class="math">\(\alpha \in R\)</span>, and hence <span class="math">\(\theta = \frac{\alpha}{f^k}\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(f^{-1}R\)</span>.</p>
<p>This pseudo-example served two purposes: the first one was elucidate the key idea behind using a priori estimates without
getting bogged into analytic technicalities. The second purpose was to illustrate that the idea of boundedness implying
existence might be a very broad principle that applies in a lot of contexts. Now we'll see an actual example of
using an priori estimate. This is Example 2 from Chapter 9 of Evans' <em>Partial Differential Equations</em>.</p>
<h3>A quasilinear elliptic PDE</h3>
<p>Consider a region <span class="math">\(U\)</span> in <span class="math">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> with a smooth boundary <span class="math">\(\partial U\)</span>. We want to solve
the following PDE.
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align*}
    - \Delta u + \mu u = -b(Du)
\end{align*}</div>
<p>
Additionally, we have that <span class="math">\(u\)</span> must be <span class="math">\(0\)</span> on the
boundary. In the above equation, <span class="math">\(\Delta\)</span> is the Laplacian, <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> some number greater than <span class="math">\(0\)</span>, <span class="math">\(b\)</span>
is a Lipschitz function, and <span class="math">\(D\)</span> is a first order partial differential operator. We want to show
that for a large enough <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> there exists a solution <span class="math">\(u \in H^2(U) \cap H^1_0(U)\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(H^2\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(H^1_0\)</span> are the appropriate Sobolev spaces (if you don't know what Sobolev spaces are, think of
these spaces as functions whose derivatives are bounded).</p>
<p>For any <span class="math">\(w \in H^1_0(U)\)</span>, define <span class="math">\(f_w\)</span> to be the function <span class="math">\(-b(Dw)\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(b\)</span> is Lipschitz, <span class="math">\(f_w\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(L^2\)</span>.
If we plug in <span class="math">\(f_w\)</span> instead of <span class="math">\(-b(Du)\)</span> in the PDE, we have the following linear PDE (after fixing <span class="math">\(w\)</span>).
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align*}
    - \Delta u + \mu u = f_w
\end{align*}</div>
<p>
By general PDE theory, linear elliptic PDEs have unique
solutions. Let the solution we get be denoted by <span class="math">\(u_w\)</span>.  By more general nonsense (i.e. elliptic
regularity and similar statements), we have that <span class="math">\(u_w\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(H^2(U)\)</span>.  We thus have a map that
takes <span class="math">\(w \in H^1_0(U)\)</span> to a <span class="math">\(u_w\)</span> in <span class="math">\(H^2\)</span>. This can also be thought of as a non-linear continuous
map from <span class="math">\(H^1_0(U)\)</span> to <span class="math">\(H^1_0(U)\)</span>. We call this map <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, and we can bound the <span class="math">\(H^2\)</span> norm of <span class="math">\(A\)</span>. The
Rellich lemma tells us that <span class="math">\(A\)</span> takes bounded sets to pre-compact sets in <span class="math">\(H^1_0\)</span>. After some more
analysis, which we'll skip, we can show that for a large enough <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span>, the following set is bounded.
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align*}
SFP = \{ w \in H^1_0(U)\ |\ w = \lambda A(w) \text{ for some $\lambda \in [0,1]$} \}
\end{align*}</div>
<p>
Observe that any <span class="math">\(w\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(w = A(w)\)</span> will be a solution of our original PDE. That means
we would like to show that <span class="math">\(A\)</span> has fixed points. What we have from our analysis so far is
that the set of scaled fixed points <span class="math">\(SFP\)</span> is bounded. This is our a priori estimate. The second
step is applying Schaefer's fixed point theorem to the map <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, which requires the set <span class="math">\(SFP\)</span> be bounded,
and gives us that the map <span class="math">\(A\)</span> has a fixed point, and hence our original PDE has a solution.</p>
<p>In both the examples, the idea of the proof was guided by the following principle: pretend a solution exists to get
bounds, and after obtaining those bounds, show that a solution actually exists.</p>
