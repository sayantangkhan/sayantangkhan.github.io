        <div><h2>Characteristic classes</h2>
<p>Given a manifold <span class="math">\(M\)</span>, one way to study vector bundles over <span class="math">\(M\)</span> is to use the theory of
characteristic classes. A characteristic class is a way of assigning to each vector bundle over <span class="math">\(M\)</span>
an element of the cohomology ring <span class="math">\(H^{\ast}(M, G)\)</span>. This assignment is not just any arbitrary
assignment; it has to satisfy a <em>naturality</em> condition. If <span class="math">\((F, N, \pi_2)\)</span> is a vector
bundle, <span class="math">\(f: M \to N\)</span> is a smooth map, (E, M, \pi_1) is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pullback_bundle">pullback bundle</a>,
and <span class="math">\(c(E)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(c(F)\)</span> are the cohomology classes assigned to <span class="math">\(E\)</span> and <span class="math">\(F\)</span> by the characteristic class
<span class="math">\(c\)</span>, then the pullback of <span class="math">\(c(F)\)</span> along the map <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is <span class="math">\(c(E)\)</span>.
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align*}
c(E) = f^{\ast}(c(F))
\end{align*}</div>
<p>
The naturality condition is what makes characteristic classes so useful: it tells us that
characteristic classes are an invariant of vector bundles over a manifold. If two vector
bundles are isomorphic, they'll get assigned the same characteristic class.</p>
<p>The first step in studying characteristic classes is to construct interesting examples of them.
Its definition is certainly of not much help in actually constructing any examples. In fact,
constructing characteristic classes is not entirely trivial, and requires some work. We'll look
at one way of constructing characteristic classes, called Chern classes. This construction
is quite non-trivial, and requires the use of differential geometric machinery. The advantage of this
construction however, is that it gives an explicit way of constructing characteristic classes over
a lot of familiar manifolds.</p>
<h2>Connections on vector bundles</h2>
<p>Given a rank <span class="math">\(k\)</span> vector bundle <span class="math">\((E, M)\)</span>, a connection on the vector bundle is a bundle map <span class="math">\(\nabla\)</span> from
<span class="math">\(E\)</span> to <span class="math">\(E \otimes T^{\ast}M\)</span> which satisfies the following condition for all smooth real-valued functions <span class="math">\(f\)</span>.
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align*}
\nabla(fv) = v \otimes df + f (\nabla v)
\end{align*}</div>
<p>
If we pick local coordinates and a trivialization around some point in <span class="math">\(M\)</span>, then the connection
<span class="math">\(\nabla\)</span> can be described by a <span class="math">\(k \times k\)</span> matrix of <span class="math">\(1\)</span>-forms, which we'll denote
<span class="math">\(A\)</span>, where the <span class="math">\(i\)</span><sup>th</sup> column
denotes what <span class="math">\(\nabla e_i\)</span> goes to, where <span class="math">\(\{e_i\}\)</span> is the local frame for the vector bundle.
The matrix <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is often called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_form">connection form</a>.
Using the matrix <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, we can construct another matrix, this one consisting of <span class="math">\(2\)</span>-forms, which we'll call
the curvature form<sup id="fnref-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>.
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align*}
\Omega = dA + A \wedge A
\end{align*}</div>
<p>
The curvature form will be the key tool we'll use to construct the Chern classes.</p>
<h2>Constructing globally defined forms using curvature</h2>
<p>The nice thing about the curvature form is that it transforms in a particularly
nice manner when one changes the trivialization for the vector bundle. If <span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span>
is the curvature matrix in the old trivialization, and the new trivialization is given
by multiplying by an invertible matrix <span class="math">\(g\)</span>, then in the new trivialization, the curvature
matrix is given by <span class="math">\(g\Omega g^{-1}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Consider the trace of the curvature matrix defined on some open set. The trace will be
a locally defined <span class="math">\(2\)</span>-form. Now recall that for any matrix <span class="math">\(M\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\mathrm{tr}(M) = \mathrm{tr}(gMg^{-1})\)</span>.
This means that we can defined a "trace" of the curvature form globally (using a partition of unity argument),
and this gives us a globally defined <span class="math">\(2\)</span>-form. In fact, this can be done for any homogeneous
polynomial in the entries of a matrix
which is conjugation invariant, e.g. the determinant. Doing this for the determinant will give
us a globally defined <span class="math">\(2k\)</span>-form. We now have a way of constructing globally defined forms
using the curvature form.</p>
<p>Let's take a pause here to recall our goal. We want to associate to each vector bundle over <span class="math">\(M\)</span>
an element of <span class="math">\(H^{\ast}(M)\)</span>. What we have done so far is to associate to each vector bundle <span class="math">\(E\)</span>
and a choice of connection <span class="math">\(\nabla\)</span> on that bundle a collection of differential forms. If we manage to show
that the differential form is actually closed, we'll have an assignment of <span class="math">\((E, \nabla)\)</span> to an element
of <span class="math">\(H^{\ast}_{DR}(M)\)</span>. Furthermore, if we show that the assignment to the cohomology class
is independent of which connection we pick, we'll have constructed a characteristic class. In the following
sections, we'll do both of the mentioned things, i.e. show that the globally defined forms are closed,
and their cohomology class is independent of the connection chosen.</p>
<h3>The globally defined forms are closed</h3>
<p>To show that the globally defined forms are closed, we'll need a systematic way of taking
their exterior derivative. The first step in that direction would be to simplify the expression
for the connection form <span class="math">\(A\)</span> by picking a nice trivialization. In fact, we can pick a trivialization
in which the connection matrix <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is <span class="math">\(0\)</span> at a point. The proof of this fact is outlined in these
<a href="http://www.math.iisc.ac.in/~vamsipingali/6Feb2018.pdf">notes</a> (and some formulae used are derived in these
<a href="http://www.math.iisc.ac.in/~vamsipingali/1Feb2018.pdf">notes</a>). We'll call this trivialization a <em>normal trivialization</em>.</p>
<p>This result already tells us that the <span class="math">\(2\)</span>-form defined by taking the trace of the curvature is
closed. Pick a normal trivialization around <span class="math">\(p\)</span>; this makes <span class="math">\(A\)</span> vanish at <span class="math">\(p\)</span>. Then at that point, the curvature
matrix is just <span class="math">\(dA\)</span>. The exterior derivative of the trace of this is the same as the trace of <span class="math">\(d^2A\)</span>
(because the trace is a homogeneous degree <span class="math">\(1\)</span> polynomial in the entries of the matrix),
which is <span class="math">\(0\)</span>.</p>
<p>To extend this idea to homogeneous polynomials of higher degrees, we need some way "linearizing" them,
so that we can take their exterior derivative easily. We do this by <em>polarizing</em> them. The polarization
of a degree <span class="math">\(j\)</span> homogeneous polynomial <span class="math">\(f\)</span> in the entries of the matrix is a function <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> that takes <span class="math">\(j\)</span>
matrix arguments, and outputs an element of the algebra over which the matrices are defined. The function <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span>
is linear in each of its arguments, is symmetric in the order of its arguments, and is conjugation invariant, i.e.
it satisfies the following identity for all invertible matrices <span class="math">\(g\)</span>.
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align*}
\phi(A_1, \ldots , A_j) = \phi(gA_1g^{-1}, \ldots , gA_jg^{-1})
\end{align*}</div>
<p>
Furthermore, <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> must also satisfy the following polarization identity for all matrices <span class="math">\(A\)</span>.
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align*}
\phi(A, \ldots , A) = f(A)
\end{align*}</div>
<p>
This last equality is why <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> is called the polarization of <span class="math">\(f\)</span>.
Constructing the polarization of a homogeneous degree <span class="math">\(j\)</span> polynomial isn't too hard.
The first step is to just construct a multilinear function that satisfies the polarization
identity. One does that by taking each monomial in the expression for <span class="math">\(f\)</span>, and replacing
the <span class="math">\(i\)</span><sup>th</sup> factor by the corresponding factor in the <span class="math">\(i\)</span><sup>th</sup> argument.</p>
<p>This is best illustrated by a simple example. Suppose we are working with <span class="math">\(2 \times 2\)</span> matrices,
and the polynomial we want to polarize is the determinant polynomial. Its expression is given
in the following manner.
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align*}
f(\{a_{ij}\}) = a_{11}a_{22} - a_{12}a_{21}
\end{align*}</div>
<p>
Its polarization <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> must have two arguments. We'll denote the entries of the first
argument by superscript <span class="math">\(1\)</span> and the second by superscript <span class="math">\(2\)</span>. Then the first step would
be two write the following expression.
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align*}
a^1_{11}a^2_{22} - a^1_{12}a^2_{21}
\end{align*}</div>
<p>Whatever we get in the previous step certainly is multilinear in the arguments and satisfies the
polarization identity. The next step is to symmetrize it. That can be easily done by taking
all permutations of the arguments and taking an average over them. This continues to satisfy
the polarization identity and is multilinear and symmetric. The only thing to do now is to make
<span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> conjugation invariant. But as it turns out, <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> is already conjugation invariant,
because <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is conjugation invariant. The proof of this fact is a little tricky,
and is outlined in the next few paragraphs.</p>
<p><strong>Lemma.</strong> If <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is a conjugation invariant degree <span class="math">\(j\)</span> polynomial in the entries 
of a matrix, and <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> is its symmetric and multilinear polarization, then <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span>
is also conjugation invariant (which we'll also call basis invariant).</p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong>     We'll prove this lemma by inducting on the number of distinct matrices in the arguments of
    <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span>. Observe that <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> can have at most <span class="math">\(j\)</span> distinct matrices as arguments. What we'll show
    is that the following equality holds, when <span class="math">\(\left\{ A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_j\right\}\)</span> contain at
    most <span class="math">\(m\)</span> distinct matrices for each <span class="math">\(1 \leq m \leq j\)</span>.
    </p>
<div class="math">\begin{align*}
      \phi\left(gA_1g^{-1}, gA_2g^{-1}, \ldots, gA_jg^{-1}\right)  = \phi\left(A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_j\right)
    \end{align*}</div>
<p>
    Let's start with the base case of <span class="math">\(m=1\)</span>. This follows from the hypothesis that <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is basis
    invariant, since <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> with all identical arguments is just the function <span class="math">\(f\)</span>. Now suppose we
    have shown the result for some <span class="math">\(m &lt; j\)</span>. We now need to show <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> is basis invariant when
    supplied with at most <span class="math">\(m+1\)</span> different arguments. Pick any set of <span class="math">\(m+1\)</span> matrices
    <span class="math">\(\left\{A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_{m+1}\right\}\)</span>, and any invertible matrix <span class="math">\(g\)</span>. We want to show the
    following equality (with some of arguments repeated possibly, if <span class="math">\(m+1 &lt; j\)</span>).
    </p>
<div class="math">\begin{align*}
      \phi\left(gA_1g^{-1}, gA_2g^{-1}, \ldots, gA_{m+1}g^{-1}\right)  = \phi\left(A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_{m+1}\right)
    \end{align*}</div>
<p>
    Consider the following expression, for <span class="math">\(t \in \mathbb{C}\)</span>.
    </p>
<div class="math">\begin{align}
      \phi\left( A_1 + tA_{m+1}, A_1 + tA_{m+1}, \ldots, A_1 + tA_{m+1}, A_2, \ldots, A_m \right) \label{eq:1}
    \end{align}</div>
<p>
    Here, <span class="math">\(A_1 + tA_{m+1}\)</span> is repeated <span class="math">\(j -m\)</span> times. Since expression <span class="math">\(\ref{eq:1}\)</span> has at most <span class="math">\(m\)</span>
    distinct arguments, we can use the induction hypothesis to conclude that expression \ref{eq:1}
    would be the same if we conjugated all arguments with <span class="math">\(g\)</span>. In fact, expression \ref{eq:1} can be
    expanded out to be written as a univariate polynomial <span class="math">\(P\)</span> in <span class="math">\(t\)</span>, with coefficients in <span class="math">\(R\)</span>. The
    coefficient <span class="math">\(c_j(P)\)</span> of <span class="math">\(t^j\)</span> in the polynomial is the following.
    </p>
<div class="math">\begin{align*}
      c_j(P) = \binom{j-m}{j} \phi\left( A_1, \ldots, A_1, A_{m+1}, \ldots, A_{m+1}, A_2, \ldots, A_m\right) 
    \end{align*}</div>
<p>
    Here <span class="math">\(A_1\)</span> is repeated <span class="math">\(j-m - j\)</span> times, and <span class="math">\(A_{m+1}\)</span> repeated <span class="math">\(j\)</span> times. Similarly, consider
    the polynomial <span class="math">\(P'\)</span> one gets by expanding out the conjugated version of expression
    \ref{eq:1}. The coefficient <span class="math">\(c_j(P')\)</span> of <span class="math">\(t^j\)</span> in <span class="math">\(P'\)</span> is given by a similar expression.
    </p>
<div class="math">\begin{align*}
      c_j(P') = \binom{j-m}{j}
      \phi\left( gA_1g^{-1}, \ldots, gA_1g^{-1}
      , gA_{m+1}g^{-1}, \ldots, gA_{m+1}g^{-1}, gA_2g^{-1}, \ldots, gA_mg^{-1}\right) 
    \end{align*}</div>
<p>
    Recall again that by the induction hypothesis, the polynomials <span class="math">\(P\)</span> and <span class="math">\(P'\)</span> are the same. Which
    means their coefficients must also be the same. But the coefficients being equal means that even
    if <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> has <span class="math">\(m+1\)</span> different entries, it's still conjugation invariant, hence proving the
    induction step, and the lemma. <span class="math">\(\blacksquare\)</span></p>
<p>The upshot of proving that every homogeneous polynomial can be polarized is that now we
have an easy way of taking exterior derivative. If <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is the degree <span class="math">\(j\)</span> homogeneous polynomial, and <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> its
polarization, then the exterior derivative of <span class="math">\(f(\Omega)\)</span> is given by the following expression.
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align*}
df(\Omega) = j \cdot \phi(d\Omega, \Omega, \Omega, \ldots , \Omega)
\end{align*}</div>
<p>
Using normal coordinates, and exploiting the multilinearity of <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span>, we see that every global
<span class="math">\(2\)</span>-form obtained from the curvature form by applying the polynomial <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is actually closed,
and hence an element of the cohomology ring. We thus have a way associating a vector bundle
and a connection on it to an element in the cohomology ring. The next step is to show
this assignment is independent of the connection chosen.</p>
<h3>Independence from choice of connection</h3>
<p>Given a homogeneous polynomial <span class="math">\(f\)</span>, and two connections <span class="math">\(\nabla_0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\nabla_1\)</span> on the vector
bundle, we need to show the associated forms <span class="math">\(f(\Omega_0)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(f(\Omega_1)\)</span> differ by an exact
form. Consider the form <span class="math">\(\eta_t = f((1-t)\Omega_0 + (t)\Omega_1)\)</span>. This defines a path in the
space of forms between f(\Omega_0) and <span class="math">\(f(\Omega_1)\)</span>. If we show <span class="math">\(\frac{d}{dt} \eta_t\)</span> is exact,
that will show what we wanted to prove. In fact, the exterior derivative of the following
form is precisely <span class="math">\(\frac{d}{dt}\eta_t\)</span>.
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align*}
j \phi \left( A_1 - A_0, \Omega_t, \Omega_t, \ldots, \Omega_t \right)
\end{align*}</div>
<p>
Here <span class="math">\(A_i\)</span> is the connection form of the connection <span class="math">\(\nabla_i\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(\Omega_t\)</span> the curvature
form of the connection <span class="math">\(\nabla_t\)</span>. If one takes the exterior derivative of this expression, using
the normal coordinates, one can see that it's the same as <span class="math">\(\frac{d}{dt} \eta_t\)</span>. This proves that 
the choice of connection doesn't matter<sup id="fnref-2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<h2>The Chern class</h2>
<p>Now that we have seen how to construct characteristic classes using the curvature form, we'll
construct a specific example, these are the ones that are called the Chern classes. Let
<span class="math">\(E\)</span> be a rank <span class="math">\(k\)</span> vector bundle, and let <span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span> be the curvature of a chosen connection on <span class="math">\(E\)</span>.
Consider the following polynomial in <span class="math">\(t\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(t \in \mathbb{R}\)</span>.
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align*}
\det(t\Omega + I) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} f_i(\Omega) t^i
\end{align*}</div>
<p>
Each of the <span class="math">\(f_i(\Omega)\)</span> are homogeneous degree <span class="math">\(i\)</span> polynomials in <span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span>. Because
the left hand side is conjugation invariant, so is each of the <span class="math">\(f_i(\Omega)\)</span>. That means
each <span class="math">\(f_i(\Omega)\)</span> defines an element (of degree <span class="math">\(2i\)</span>) in the cohomology ring of the base space <span class="math">\(M\)</span>.
The <span class="math">\(i\)</span><sup>th</sup> Chern class of the vector bundle <span class="math">\(E\)</span> is defined to be <span class="math">\(f_i(\Omega)\)</span>. The previous part 
shows that this is well defined independent of the connection chosen.</p>
<p>The Chern classes satisfy several nice properties, including a product formula
for the Whitney sum of two vector bundles, naturality, etc. The Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chern_class#Construction_of_Chern_classes">page</a>
provides a good description, as well as references for further reading.</p>
