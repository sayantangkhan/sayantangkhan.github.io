        <div><p>In the <a href="/orbit-points-2.0.html">previous post</a>, we proved Sullivan's shadow lemma, which gave
us concrete estimates for special subsets of the boundary, namely <em>shadows</em>. Recall that the shadow of a ball of
radius <span class="math">\(r\)</span> based at <span class="math">\(y\)</span>, with the source at <span class="math">\(x\)</span>, denoted by <span class="math">\(\mathcal{O}_r(x, y)\)</span>, is the set of all points <span class="math">\(z\)</span>
in the boundary <span class="math">\(\partial \mathbb{H}^2\)</span> such that a geodesic from <span class="math">\(x\)</span> to <span class="math">\(z\)</span> gets within distance <span class="math">\(r\)</span> of <span class="math">\(y\)</span>. In the
special case when <span class="math">\(y\)</span> and <span class="math">\(x\)</span> lie in the same orbit, we can estimate the Patterson-Sullivan measure of the shadow.</p>
<p><strong>Lemma</strong> (Sullivan's shadow lemma):  Let <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span> be a non-elementary discrete group, and let <span class="math">\(\{\mu_x\}_{x \in \mathbb{H}^2}\)</span> be a <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span>-invariant conformal density of
  dimension <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span>. Then for any <span class="math">\(x\)</span> there exists a large enough <span class="math">\(r_0\)</span>, such that for all
  <span class="math">\(r \geq r_0\)</span>, there exists a <span class="math">\(C &gt; 0\)</span>, depending on <span class="math">\(r\)</span> for which the following inequality holds
  for all <span class="math">\(\gamma \in \Gamma\)</span>.
  </p>
<div class="math">\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{C} e^{-\delta \cdot d(x, \gamma x)} \leq \mu_{x}\left( \mathcal{O}_r(x, \gamma x) \right) \leq  C e^{-\delta \cdot d(x, \gamma x)}
 \end{equation}</div>
<p>We went through all the trouble of developing the machinery of Patterson-Sullivan theory to answer the following
question.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Suppose <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span> is a <em>convex-cocompact group</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.  Let <span class="math">\(x_0\)</span> be a point in <span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span>, and let
  <span class="math">\(C(r)\)</span> be the number of points in the orbit <span class="math">\(\Gamma x_0\)</span> that lie within distance <span class="math">\(r\)</span> of <span class="math">\(x_0\)</span>. What can we
  say about the asymptotics of <span class="math">\(C(r)\)</span>? Do we have asymptotic upper and lower bounds? Can we determine what
  <span class="math">\(C(r)\)</span> is asymptotically equal to?</p>
<p>One can prove a somewhat weak asymptotic upper bound without using any Patterson-Sullivan theory.</p>
<p><strong>Proposition</strong>: <span class="math">\(C(r)\)</span> is less than <span class="math">\(e^r\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>: Since the group <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span> is discrete, there exists a small enough constant <span class="math">\(r_0 &gt; 0\)</span>, such that for
  any pair of points in the orbit <span class="math">\(\Gamma x_0\)</span> are distance at least <span class="math">\(2r_0\)</span> apart. Let <span class="math">\(S_r\)</span> be the set of
  orbit points within distance <span class="math">\(r\)</span> of <span class="math">\(x_0\)</span>, and let <span class="math">\(T_r\)</span> be the union of balls of radius <span class="math">\(r_0\)</span> around each
  point of <span class="math">\(S_r\)</span>.  These balls don't intersect. Furthermore, all these balls lie in the ball of radius <span class="math">\(r+
  r_0\)</span> around <span class="math">\(x_0\)</span>.  The volume of a ball of radius <span class="math">\(r\)</span> is <span class="math">\(ke^{r}\)</span> for a constant <span class="math">\(k\)</span>. We also note
  that the volume of <span class="math">\(T_r\)</span> must be less than the volume of the ball of radius <span class="math">\(r+r_0\)</span>. This gives us that
  following inequality.
  </p>
<div class="math">\begin{align*}
  k C(r) e^{r_0} \leq ke^{(r+r_0)}
  \end{align*}</div>
<p>
  Rearranging the above inequality gives us the result. <span class="math">\(\square\)</span></p>
<p>Since we didn't have to work very hard to prove this inequality, it shouldn't come as a surprise
that this bound is far from sharp. We can prove a better inequality by using Sullivan's shadow lemma.
For simplicity, we'll first estimate the quantity <span class="math">\(A(r)\)</span> instead, which is
the number of orbit points contained in an annulus of inner radius <span class="math">\(r-1\)</span> and outer radius <span class="math">\(r\)</span> about
the point <span class="math">\(x_0\)</span>. The value of <span class="math">\(C(r)\)</span> can be obtained by just adding up the values of <span class="math">\(A(r)\)</span>,
i.e. <span class="math">\(C(r) = \sum_{i=1}^{r} A(r)\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proposition</strong>: Suppose <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> is the critical exponent<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> of <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span>. Then there exists a positive constant
<span class="math">\(k\)</span> which makes the following inequalities involving <span class="math">\(A(r)\)</span> hold for all <span class="math">\(r\)</span>.
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align*}
    \frac{1}{k} e^{\delta r} \leq A(r) \leq k e^{\delta r}
\end{align*}</div>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>: We begin by defining the set <span class="math">\(\alpha_r\)</span>: this is the set of elements <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span> in <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span> such
  that <span class="math">\(\gamma x_0\)</span> lands in the annulus of inner radius <span class="math">\(r-1\)</span> and outer radius <span class="math">\(r\)</span> about <span class="math">\(x_0\)</span>,
  i.e. <span class="math">\(\gamma x_0\)</span> contributes to <span class="math">\(A(r)\)</span>.  Consider the following function defined on
  <span class="math">\(\partial \mathbb{H}^2\)</span>.
  </p>
<div class="math">\begin{align*}
    S(\xi) := \sum_{\gamma \in \alpha_r} \mathbb{1}_{\mathcal{O}_{r_0}(x, \gamma x)}(\xi)
  \end{align*}</div>
<p>
  Here, <span class="math">\(r_0\)</span> is some big enough constant such that the Sullivan's shadow lemma applies. Note that
  this function depends on <span class="math">\(r\)</span> as well, although the notation hides that dependence. That's because
  this function can be uniformly bounded above and below, independent of what <span class="math">\(r\)</span> is. The lower
  bound of course, is just <span class="math">\(0\)</span>, which is trivial, but the upper bound requires proof. For any point
  <span class="math">\(\xi\)</span> on the boundary, the value of <span class="math">\(S(\xi)\)</span> will depend on how many balls of radius <span class="math">\(r_0\)</span> about
  points in <span class="math">\(\alpha(r)\)</span> intersect the geodesic going from <span class="math">\(x\)</span> to <span class="math">\(\xi\)</span>. By an application of the
  triangle inequality, it suffices to count how many of these balls intersect a segment of length
  <span class="math">\(2r_0 + 1\)</span> depicted in Figure 1.
  <table class="image">
<caption align="bottom">Figure 1: Line segment indicating where <span class="math">\(S(\xi)\)</span> may get some contribution from.</caption>
<tr><td><img src="../images/orbit-points-3/fig1.png" width="70%" height="auto" class="center"/></td></tr>
</table></p>
<p>This means that <span class="math">\(S(\xi)\)</span> is at most the number of orbit points contained in a neighbourhood of radius <span class="math">\(r_0\)</span>
  about the segment of length <span class="math">\(2r_0 + 1\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(r_0\)</span> is fixed, this quantity is bounded above no matter where
  the segment is on <span class="math">\(\mathbb{H}^2\)</span>, which proves the uniform upper bound on the function <span class="math">\(S\)</span>. Let us denote this
  uniform bound by <span class="math">\(J\)</span>. This uniform upper bound will help us get an upper bound on <span class="math">\(A(r)\)</span>. Observe that
  showing the upper bound didn't require convex-cocompactness, and in fact works for any discrete group
  <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span>.</p>
<p>We can use convex-cocompactness of <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span> to get a positive lower bound on <span class="math">\(S(\xi)\)</span> when <span class="math">\(\xi\)</span> is in the limit
  set <span class="math">\(\Lambda(\Gamma)\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span> is convex cocompact, the restriction of a fundamental domain to the convex
  hull of the limit set will be compact. Without loss of generality, we can assume the diameter of this compact
  set is less than <span class="math">\(1\)</span> (otherwise we just make the annuli thicker). If <span class="math">\(\xi\)</span> is in the limit set, the geodesic
  from <span class="math">\(x_0\)</span> to <span class="math">\(\xi\)</span> is always within distance <span class="math">\(1\)</span> of some orbit point, since the closure of the orbits
  of the compact set contain the limit set. This means <span class="math">\(S(\xi) \geq 1\)</span>, and proves the lower bound.</p>
<p>We have, with some effort, managed to prove our main inequality, which holds for all <span class="math">\(\xi\)</span> in the
  radial limit set, which has full measure.
  </p>
<div class="math">\begin{align}
    \label{eq:4}
    1 \leq S(\xi) \leq J
  \end{align}</div>
<p>
  We now integrate this with respect to the Patterson-Sullivan measure <span class="math">\(\mu_x\)</span>, and interchange the
  sum and the integral to get the following inequality.
  </p>
<div class="math">\begin{align}
    \label{eq:8}
    \mu_x(\partial \Omega) \leq \sum_{\gamma \in \alpha_r} \mu_x\left( \mathcal{O}_r(x, \gamma x) \right) \leq J \mu_x(\partial \Omega)
  \end{align}</div>
<p>
  Sullivan's shadow lemma also gives us another useful inequality.
  </p>
<div class="math">\begin{align}
    \label{eq:9}
    \frac{1}{C} \sum_{\gamma \in \alpha_r} e^{-\delta r} \leq \sum_{\gamma \in \alpha_r} \mu_x\left( \mathcal{O}_r(x, \gamma x) \right) \leq C \sum_{\gamma \in \alpha_r} e^{-\delta r}
  \end{align}</div>
<p>
  Combining inequalities \eqref{eq:8} and \eqref{eq:9}, we get the inequalities we were after.
  </p>
<div class="math">\begin{align}
    \label{eq:10}
    \frac{1}{k} e^{\delta r} \leq A(r) \leq k e^{\delta r}
  \end{align}</div>
<p>
  Summing up the <span class="math">\(A(r)\)</span> gives us a similar inequality for <span class="math">\(C(r)\)</span>, which is what we wanted. <span class="math">\(\square\)</span></p>
<p>We have improved upon our earlier naïve inequalities in two ways. First, we now have a lower bound
too. Secondly, if we know that <span class="math">\(\delta &lt; 1\)</span>, we will have a strictly better inequality. Of course,
this is only an improvement if we can actually find groups <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span> where the critical exponent
<span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> is less than <span class="math">\(1\)</span>. Schottky groups provide a family of such examples.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: (Schottky groups) Let <span class="math">\(x_0 \in \mathbb{H}^2\)</span> be a basepoint. Let <span class="math">\(a_1\)</span> be a hyperbolic isometry whose axis passes through
  <span class="math">\(x_0\)</span>, and translates <span class="math">\(x_0\)</span> by distance <span class="math">\(d\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(d\)</span> is a constant we'll fix later, and <span class="math">\(a_2\)</span> be
  another hyperbolic isometry with translation distance <span class="math">\(d\)</span> whose axis also passes through <span class="math">\(x_0\)</span>,
  and is perpendicular to the axis of <span class="math">\(a_1\)</span>. For <span class="math">\(d\)</span> large enough, <span class="math">\(a_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(a_2\)</span> generate a free
  subgroup of <span class="math">\(\mathrm{PSL}(2, \mathbb{R})\)</span>: this will be our group <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span>. To get an upper bound on the
  critical exponent of <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span>, we need to relate the word length of elements of <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span> to the
  distance they translate <span class="math">\(x_0\)</span> by. Suppose we had the following inequality for all elements
  <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span> in <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span>.
  </p>
<div class="math">\begin{align}
    \label{eq:11}
    |\gamma| d' - c \leq \mathrm{dist}(x_0, \gamma x_0)
  \end{align}</div>
<p>
  We could use this to determine for what values of <span class="math">\(s\)</span> does the following infinite sum converge
  (recall that this infinite sum showed up in the construction of the Patterson-Sullivan measure).
  </p>
<div class="math">\begin{align*}
    \sum_{\gamma \in \Gamma} \exp(-s \cdot d(x_0, \gamma x_0))
    &amp;= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \sum_{|\gamma| = n} \exp(-s \cdot d(x_0, \gamma x_0)) \\
    &amp;\leq \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \sum_{|\gamma| = n} \exp(-s \cdot (nd' - c)) \\
    &amp;\leq \sum_{n=0} k 3^n \exp(-snd') \\
    &amp;= \sum_{n=0} k \exp(\ln 3 - snd')
  \end{align*}</div>
<p>
  Clearly, for large values of <span class="math">\(s\)</span>, this converges, to no one's surprise. But since we want the
  critical exponent to be less than <span class="math">\(1\)</span>, would like this to converge for <span class="math">\(s &lt; 1\)</span>. We could make that
  happen if we <span class="math">\(d'\)</span> could get arbitrarily large: we claim that as <span class="math">\(d\)</span> gets larger, so does <span class="math">\(d'\)</span>.</p>
<p>To prove the above claim, we need to do some elementary hyperbolic geometry. Firstly, observe that
  if the world length of <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span> is <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, then the geodesic joining <span class="math">\(x_0\)</span> to <span class="math">\(\gamma x_0\)</span> goes
  through <span class="math">\((n-2)\)</span> translates of the fundamental domain of <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span>. The boundary of the fundamental
  domain is composed of <span class="math">\(4\)</span> biinfinite geodesics, such that the distance between each pair is
  bounded below, away from <span class="math">\(0\)</span>. That lower bound on the distance is where <span class="math">\(d'\)</span> comes from. One can
  explicitly relate <span class="math">\(d\)</span> and <span class="math">\(d'\)</span> in this manner by constructing a hyperbolic right pentagon. The details
  of this construction are elementary, and left to the reader, and after that point, one uses the formula for
  hyperbolic right angled pentagons (see Thurston's, <a href="http://library.msri.org/books/gt3m/PDF/Thurston-gt3m.pdf">The Geometry and Topology of Three-Manifolds</a>) to get the formula for <span class="math">\(d'\)</span>. Roughly,
  as <span class="math">\(d\)</span> gets larger, <span class="math">\(d'\)</span> is approximately <span class="math">\(2d\)</span>, which certainly approaches infinity, proving our claim.</p>
<p>This example shows us that Patterson-Sullivan theory did give us a strong estimate of the count of the orbit
  points. This concludes the three part series on counting orbit points. All of this material can be found in
  Dennis Sullivan's excellent paper, titled <a href="http://www.numdam.org/article/PMIHES_1979__50__171_0.pdf">The density at infinity of a discrete group of hyperbolic motions</a>.</p>
