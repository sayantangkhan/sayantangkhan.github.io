count of orbit points under a lattice action, i.e. a finite covolume Fuchsian group. To do so, we needed the
fact that the geodesic flow on the associated quotient was mixing with respect to the Liouville
measure. That suggests that if we want to get asymptotic counting for the orbit of an infinite
covolume Fuchsian group, we might want to show mixing of the geodesic flow for the associated
quotient space. However, proving mixing with respect to the Liouville measure is pointless, since
the Liouville measure is infinite. What we need therefore, is a some other measure on the unit tangent
bundle that is invariant under and mixing with respect to the geodesic flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a class of Fuchsian groups known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_finiteness"&gt;geometrically finite
groups&lt;/a&gt;, such a measure does exist: it's called
the &lt;a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Bowen-Margulis_measure"&gt;Bowen-Margulis measure&lt;/a&gt;. The construction
of this measure is fairly involved, and will take up several blog posts, but the intermediate constructions
are interesting in their own right. We will start off by looking at a family of measures associated to a
geometrically finite group &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma\)&lt;/span&gt; on the limit set &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Lambda(\Gamma)\)&lt;/span&gt;, which is a subset of the boundary
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\partial \mathbb{H}^2\)&lt;/span&gt;. These measures are called the Patterson-Sullivan measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we describe how the Patterson-Sullivan measures on the boundary are constructed, it will be
useful to make explicit what properties we would like for them to have.  We want this measure to
respect the dimension of the limit set, at least infinitesimally. What that means is that if there's
set of radius &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(r\)&lt;/span&gt; which has measure &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mu\)&lt;/span&gt;, and if it's size is doubled to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(2r\)&lt;/span&gt;, then it's measure
should becomes &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(2^\delta\)&lt;/span&gt; times the original measure, where &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\delta\)&lt;/span&gt; in some sense is the dimension
of the limit set. In other words, whatever measure we construct on the limit set has to be
compatible with the metric on the limit set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note however that the boundary &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\partial \mathbb{H}^2\)&lt;/span&gt; (and the limit set &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Lambda(\Gamma)\)&lt;/span&gt; by extension),
doesn't have a canonical metric. Instead, it has a family of metrics, all conformal to each other,
and every one of those metrics come from a point &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x \in \mathbb{H}^2\)&lt;/span&gt;. The metric associated to each point
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; comes from the identification of the unit tangent sphere at that point to the boundary. Suppose
we did have a family of measures &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mu_x\)&lt;/span&gt; one for each point, that satisfied the scaling
property. That would then mean that for any two points &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(y\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mu_x\)&lt;/span&gt; was absolutely
continuous with respect to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mu_y\)&lt;/span&gt; (and the other way round), and the Radon-Nikodym derivative
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{d\mu_y}{d\mu_x}\)&lt;/span&gt; would be
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\left( \frac{g_y}{g_x} \right)^{\delta}\)&lt;/span&gt;, where &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(g_y\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(g_x\)&lt;/span&gt; are the associated
metrics. For negatively curved spaces, the ratio &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\left( \frac{g_y}{g_x} \right)\)&lt;/span&gt;
at a point &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\xi\)&lt;/span&gt; in the boundary is actually the Busemann function &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(e^{\beta_{\xi}(y,x)}\)&lt;/span&gt;. This lets us
define what we want our family of measures to be in a more precise manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition&lt;/strong&gt;: A conformal density of dimension &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\delta\)&lt;/span&gt; on
  &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\partial \mathbb{H}^2\)&lt;/span&gt; is a family of Radon measures &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\{\mu_x\}_{x \in \mathbb{H}^2}\)&lt;/span&gt; such that all of them lie in
  the same measure class, and their Radon-Nikodym derivatives satisfy the following property.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:1}
    \frac{d\mu_y}{d\mu_x}(\xi) = \left(e^{\beta_{\xi}(y,x)} \right)^\delta
  \end{equation}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of conformal densities aren't too hard to construct. For instance, the Hausdorff &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\delta\)&lt;/span&gt;
measure on the limit set &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Lambda(\Gamma)\)&lt;/span&gt; is a conformal density of dimension &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\delta\)&lt;/span&gt;, where
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\delta\)&lt;/span&gt; is the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set. However, this is not the only property we want
our family of measures to satisfy. We want this family of measures to also capture which part
of the boundary do the orbit points go to. That means our family of measures should be equivariant
with respect to the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma\)&lt;/span&gt; action, i.e. the pushforward of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mu_x\)&lt;/span&gt; under &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\gamma \in \Gamma\)&lt;/span&gt; should be
the same as the measure &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mu_{\gamma x}\)&lt;/span&gt;. If a conformal density satisfies this property, we say that
conformal density is invariant under &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition&lt;/strong&gt;: A conformal density &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\{\mu_x\}_{x \in \mathbb{H}^2}\)&lt;/span&gt; is said to be &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma\)&lt;/span&gt;-invariant if
  the following identity holds for all &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x \in \mathbb{H}^2\)&lt;/span&gt;, and all &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\gamma \in \Gamma\)&lt;/span&gt;.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:2}
  \gamma_{\ast} \mu_x = \mu_{\gamma x}
  \end{equation}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Furthermore, we will also assume
  that all these measures are supported on &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Lambda(\Gamma)\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns the definition of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma\)&lt;/span&gt;-invariant conformal density is restrictive enough to let us
deduce many properties of the measure without actually explicitly working with such a measure. For
instance, one can deduce from the definition that such a family of measures is quasi-ergodic with
respect to the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma\)&lt;/span&gt; action on &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\partial \mathbb{H}^2\)&lt;/span&gt;. However, before we start proving such results,
we should verify that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma\)&lt;/span&gt;-invariant conformal densities actually exist, otherwise, any theorem
we prove about &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma\)&lt;/span&gt;-invariant conformal densities will have no content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The construction we will show first appeared in a paper by S.J. Patterson&lt;sup id="fnref:paper1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:paper1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and was
later generalized to all hyperbolic spaces in by Dennis Sullivan&lt;sup id="fnref:paper2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:paper2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
The idea behind the construction of the Patterson-Sullivan measures is quite clever (and hard to
come up with), but easy to understand. One starts off with a family of measures &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mu_{x}^s\)&lt;/span&gt;, for
every &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x \in \mathbb{H}^2\)&lt;/span&gt;, and where &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(s\)&lt;/span&gt; is some large enough real number that makes the infinite sum
converge (assuming it exists).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation}
  \mu_x^s = \frac{\sum_{\gamma \in \Gamma} e^{-s \cdot d(x, \gamma x)} \delta_{\gamma x_0} }{\sum_{\gamma \in \Gamma} e^{-s \cdot d(x, \gamma x)} }
\end{equation}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For large enough &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(s\)&lt;/span&gt;, the infinite series in the denominator converges, giving us a probability
measure on &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbb{H}^2\)&lt;/span&gt; (and not &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\partial \mathbb{H}^2\)&lt;/span&gt;).  Also, it turns out that this choice of
normalization isn't quite right: the family &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\{\mu_{x}^s\}_{x \in \mathbb{H}^2}\)&lt;/span&gt; doesn't quite transform
like \eqref{eq:1} and \eqref{eq:2}, but it's close. The correct normalization as it turns out, comes
from picking a fixed point &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x_0 \in \mathbb{H}^2\)&lt;/span&gt;, and modifying &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mu_x^s\)&lt;/span&gt; in the following manner.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation}
  \mu_x^s = \frac{\sum_{\gamma \in \Gamma} e^{-s \cdot d(x, \gamma x_0)} \delta_{\gamma x} }{\sum_{\gamma \in \Gamma} e^{-s \cdot d(x_0, \gamma x_0)} }
\end{equation}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This family of measures is no longer a probability measure, unless &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x = x_0\)&lt;/span&gt;, but for a fixed &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt;, it's still a finite
measure. In fact, the total mass of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mu_x^s\)&lt;/span&gt; satisfies the following inequality.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation}
  e^{-s \cdot d(x, x_0)} \leq \lVert{\mu_x^s}\rVert \leq e^{s \cdot d(x, x_0)}
\end{equation}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next thing we do is observe that for large enough &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(s\)&lt;/span&gt;, the infinite sum
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(g(s) := \sum_{\gamma \in \Gamma} e^{-s \cdot d(x_0, \gamma x_0)}\)&lt;/span&gt; does actually converge. The
easy way to see it is to get an asymptotic upper bound on how many points of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma x_0\)&lt;/span&gt; lie in a
ball radius &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(r\)&lt;/span&gt; around &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x_0\)&lt;/span&gt;. An upper bound that works for us is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(c e^{r}\)&lt;/span&gt;,
which means that an &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(s \geq n-1\)&lt;/span&gt; will make the infinite series converge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, for small enough &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(s\)&lt;/span&gt;, the series &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(g(s)\)&lt;/span&gt; will diverge. Which means there is a
critical exponent &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\delta\)&lt;/span&gt;, depending on the group &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma\)&lt;/span&gt; such for all &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(s &amp;gt; \delta\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(g(s)\)&lt;/span&gt;
converges, and for all &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(s &amp;lt; \delta\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(g(s)\)&lt;/span&gt; diverges. Suppose &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(g(\delta)\)&lt;/span&gt; actually diverges. Then we
could pick a sequence &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\{s_i\}\)&lt;/span&gt;, going down to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\delta\)&lt;/span&gt;, and look at the sequence of measures
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mu_x^{s_i}\)&lt;/span&gt;. Since these can be thought of as measures on &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\overline{\mathbb{H}^2}\)&lt;/span&gt;, which is compact,
and the mass of all these measures is bounded by inequality &lt;em&gt;(5)&lt;/em&gt;, one can pick out a
convergent subsequence. Since we assumed &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(g(\delta)\)&lt;/span&gt; actually diverged, the limit measure &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mu_x\)&lt;/span&gt;
will actually be supported on the limit set &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Lambda(\Gamma)\)&lt;/span&gt;, and satisfy the properties we want
it to satisfy (we will verify that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the rough idea behind the Patterson-Sullivan construction. However, there are many questions
that one needs to answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does one do if &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(g(\delta)\)&lt;/span&gt; does not diverge?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does this measure depend on the choice of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\{s_i\}\)&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does it depend on the choice of basepoint &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x_0\)&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first problem was dealt with by Patterson in Lemma 3.1 of his paper. The idea is
to attach additional weights to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(e^{-s \cdot d(x,\gamma x_0)}\)&lt;/span&gt; by multiplying it with
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(h(d(x, \gamma x_0))\)&lt;/span&gt;, where &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(h\)&lt;/span&gt; is a function from &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbb{R}_+\)&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbb{R}_+\)&lt;/span&gt;, which grows slowly, i.e. it
makes the infinite series diverge for exponent &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\delta\)&lt;/span&gt;, but still converge for larger exponents. We
also require that for any &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(d\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\lim_{r \to \infty} \frac{h(r + d)}{h(r)} = 1\)&lt;/span&gt;. The last
condition ensures that this modified measure transforms like the original measure in the limit.&lt;sup id="fnref2:paper1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:paper1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second and the third questions can be answered by proving a rather general theorem about the uniqueness
of the constructed measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theorem&lt;/strong&gt; (Uniqueness):   Let &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\{\nu_x\}_{x \in \mathbb{H}^2}\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\{\mu_x\}_{x \in \mathbb{H}^2}\)&lt;/span&gt; be two &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma\)&lt;/span&gt;-invariant conformal densities of the same dimension
  &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\delta\)&lt;/span&gt;. Then &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\{\mu_x\}_{x \in \mathbb{H}^2}\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\{\nu_x\}_{x \in \mathbb{H}^2}\)&lt;/span&gt; are the same up to
  scaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This statement of the above theorem is equivalent to the following statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theorem&lt;/strong&gt; (Quasi-ergodicity):   Let &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\nu\)&lt;/span&gt; be a &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma\)&lt;/span&gt;-invariant conformal density. Then the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma\)&lt;/span&gt; action on the boundary &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\partial \mathbb{H}^2\)&lt;/span&gt; is
  quasi-ergodic with respect to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\nu\)&lt;/span&gt;, i.e. any &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma\)&lt;/span&gt;-invariant sets have full measure
  or zero measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The equivalence of these two statements is straightforward to see. Suppose one had a non-trivial
invariant set &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(U\)&lt;/span&gt;. One could then condition the measure on &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(U\)&lt;/span&gt; to get a &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma\)&lt;/span&gt;-invariant conformal
density that wasn't a scalar multiple of the original &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma\)&lt;/span&gt;-invariant conformal density. That
would contradict uniqueness. On the other hand, if one had two &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma\)&lt;/span&gt;-invariant conformal
densities, their Radon-Nikodym derivative would be a &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma\)&lt;/span&gt; invariant function, and hence constant
almost everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although in principle, we can prove quasi-ergodicity using just the results we have now, the
appropriate place for its proof is the post on the ergodicity of the geodesic flow. One may worry
that in the process of doing so, its proof may become circular, i.e. it may use uniqueness. The fact
that this does not happen can be verified skipping ahead to the relevant section.&lt;sup id="fnref:footnote3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:footnote3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the foundational question has been dealt with, one is faced a (relatively) more mundane
problem: how does one actually measure the Patterson-Sullivan measure of a given set, or at least,
get a good estimate. To this end, we have Sullivan's shadow lemma.  Before we state the lemma, we
need to define what a shadow is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition&lt;/strong&gt; (Shadow): For any points &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\overline{\mathbb{H}^2}\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(y\)&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbb{H}^2\)&lt;/span&gt;, and any &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(r
  \geq 0\)&lt;/span&gt;, the shadow &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{O}_r(x, y)\)&lt;/span&gt; is the set of all points &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\xi\)&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\partial \mathbb{H}^2\)&lt;/span&gt; such
  that the geodesic from &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\xi\)&lt;/span&gt; intersects a ball of radius &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(r\)&lt;/span&gt; around &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(y\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="image"&gt;
&lt;caption align="bottom"&gt;Figure 1: The point ξ lies in the shadow cast by a ball around y and a light
source at x. Image taken from

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="../images/orbit-points-2/shadow1.png" width="100%" height="auto" class="center"/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lemma&lt;/strong&gt; (Sullivan's shadow lemma):  Let &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma\)&lt;/span&gt; be a non-elementary discrete group, and let &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\{\mu_x\}_{x \in \mathbb{H}^2}\)&lt;/span&gt; be a &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma\)&lt;/span&gt;-invariant conformal density of
  dimension &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\delta\)&lt;/span&gt;. Then for any &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; there exists a large enough &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(r_0\)&lt;/span&gt;, such that for all
  &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(r \geq r_0\)&lt;/span&gt;, there exists a &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(C &amp;gt; 0\)&lt;/span&gt;, depending on &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(r\)&lt;/span&gt; for which the following inequality holds
  for all &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\gamma \in \Gamma\)&lt;/span&gt;.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{C} e^{-\delta \cdot d(x, \gamma x)} \leq \mu_{x}\left( \mathcal{O}_r(x, \gamma x) \right) \leq  C e^{-\delta \cdot d(x, \gamma x)}
  \end{equation}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof&lt;/strong&gt;:   The first thing we need to show is that there exists an &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(r\)&lt;/span&gt; large enough, and an &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\varepsilon\)&lt;/span&gt; small
  enough such that the following inequality holds for all &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(y \in \overline{\Omega}\)&lt;/span&gt;.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:5}
    1 \geq \mu_x\left( \mathcal{O}_r(y, x) \right) \geq \varepsilon
  \end{equation}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  As &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(r\)&lt;/span&gt; gets larger, the set &lt;span class="math"&gt;\( \mathcal{O}_r(y, x)\)&lt;/span&gt; gets larger as well, and contains everything
  but the endpoint of the geodesic from &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(y\)&lt;/span&gt;. That means the only way this inequality can fail
  to hold is if all the mass of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mu_x\)&lt;/span&gt; was concentrated at that point. But since &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma\)&lt;/span&gt; is
  non-elementary, the measure &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mu_x\)&lt;/span&gt; cannot be supported on a single point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="image"&gt;
&lt;caption align="bottom"&gt;Figure 2: A large ball around x casts a very large shadow. Image taken from
&lt;a href="https://www.math.u-bordeaux.fr/~jquint/publications/courszurich.pdf"&gt;(a)n overview of Patterson-Sullivan theory&lt;/a&gt; by J.F. Quint. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="../images/orbit-points-2/shadow2.png" width="100%" height="auto" class="center"/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now rewrite &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mu_x\left( \mathcal{O}_r(x, \gamma x) \right)\)&lt;/span&gt; using identities \eqref{eq:1} and \eqref{eq:2}.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:6}
    \mu_x\left( \mathcal{O}_r(x, \gamma x) \right) = \int_{\mathcal{O}_r(\gamma^{-1}x, x)} e^{-\delta \cdot \beta_{\xi}(\gamma^{-1}x, x)} d\mu_x(\xi)
  \end{equation}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Since we already know &lt;span class="math"&gt;\( \mu_x\left( \mathcal{O}_r(\gamma^{-1}x, x) \right)\)&lt;/span&gt; is between &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(1\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\varepsilon\)&lt;/span&gt;,
  all we need to do is estimate the Busemann function on the shadow. We can do that using the triangle
  inequality, which gives us the following inequality.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:7}
    d(\gamma^{-1}x, x) - 2r \leq \beta_{\xi}(\gamma^{-1}x, x) \leq d(\gamma^{-1}x, x)
  \end{equation}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Combining \eqref{eq:5}, \eqref{eq:6}, and \eqref{eq:7}, we get the inequality we need. &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\square\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this may seem like it has noting to do with counting, but in fact, we already have developed enough tools
to get a rough asymptotic count of the orbit points for convex cocompact groups, but that will have to wait for
the next post because I think this post is long enough already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proof goes via the proof of the fact that the Bowen-Margulis measure is an ergodic
  measure for the geodesic flow. At this point, it's natural to ask why is the easiest proof of
  ergodicity of the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma\)&lt;/span&gt;-action via the ergodicity of the geodesic flow. A somewhat
  unsatisfactory answer to that is that the geodesic flow and the Bowen-Margulis measure have
  structures that are compatible with each other: the geodesic flow has stable and unstable
  manifolds, and the Bowen-Margulis measure happens to decompose nicely along these foliations.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:footnote3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

it might be a good idea use this blog to keep track of the math I've been working on. That way my blog
can act as a public version of my research notebook, and be a good place to relearn this material if I
happen to forget the details in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been learning some Patterson-Sullivan theory for the past few weeks with the goal of using the
theory to solve some counting problems. To be more precise, I'm working with the following setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(X\)&lt;/span&gt; is an unbounded metric space (in practice, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(X\)&lt;/span&gt; is usually &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbb{R}^n\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbb{H}^n\)&lt;/span&gt;, or
      &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{T}_{g}\)&lt;/span&gt; (the Teichmüller space of genus &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(g\)&lt;/span&gt; surfaces)).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma\)&lt;/span&gt; is a discrete group acting on &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(X\)&lt;/span&gt; via isometries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given a point &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x \in X\)&lt;/span&gt;, and a radius &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(r\)&lt;/span&gt;, I'm interested in knowing how many points of the orbit of
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; under &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma\)&lt;/span&gt;, which we'll denote &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma x\)&lt;/span&gt;, lie in a ball of radius &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(r\)&lt;/span&gt; about &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; (which
we'll denote by &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(B(x, r)\)&lt;/span&gt;). Since we're dealing with a discrete group, the number of orbit points
clearly won't be a continuous function of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(r\)&lt;/span&gt;, which means we can't expect a nice exact answer, but
we can ask questions about the asymptotics of the orbit counting function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's instructive to start off with the simplest example: our metric space is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbb{R}^2\)&lt;/span&gt;, and our
discrete group &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma\)&lt;/span&gt; is just the group generated by translations by &lt;span class="math"&gt;\((0,1)\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\((1,0)\)&lt;/span&gt;. If we
pick &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; to be the point &lt;span class="math"&gt;\((0.5,0.5)\)&lt;/span&gt; (we're picking this point so our pictures look nicer), our
orbit counting question translates to the following question: How many half-integer points does a ball of
radius &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(r\)&lt;/span&gt; contain? A way to answer this question is to think of the fundamental domain of the group
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma\)&lt;/span&gt;. If the ball contains &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt; points, we might expect it to contain &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt; copies of the fundamental domain,
which means we'd expect it have &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt; times the area of a fundamental domain. That's not quite correct, as the following
picture demonstrates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="image"&gt;
&lt;caption align="bottom"&gt;Figure 1: The black orbit points have their fundamental domains completely in the ball, whereas the red ones don't. The ball also
has parts of fundamental domains for which it doesn't contain the corresponding orbit point.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="../images/orbit-points-1/fig1.png" width="70%" height="auto" class="center"/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, since the fundamental domain has diameter bounded by &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(1\)&lt;/span&gt;, we can expand and contract our ball slightly to get
upper and lower bounds in terms of area. If we denote the number of orbit points in a ball of radius &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(r\)&lt;/span&gt; as &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(C(r)\)&lt;/span&gt;,
we get the following inequality for &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(C(r)\)&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
\frac{\text{Area}(B(x, r-1))}{\text{Area}(\text{Fundamental domain})} \leq C(r) \leq \frac{\text{Area}(B(x, r+1))}{\text{Area}(\text{Fundamental domain})}
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note now for large values of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(r\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\text{Area}(x, r-1)\)&lt;/span&gt; is approximately equal to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\text{Area}(x,
r+1)\)&lt;/span&gt;, i.e. their ratio approaches &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(0\)&lt;/span&gt;. That means for large values of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(r\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(C(r)\)&lt;/span&gt; behaves like
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{\text{Area}(B(x, r+1))}{\text{Area}(\text{Fundamental domain})}\)&lt;/span&gt;. This only works out because
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{(r+1)^2}{(r-1)^2}\)&lt;/span&gt; approaches &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(1\)&lt;/span&gt; as &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(r\)&lt;/span&gt; gets larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result in the case of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbb{R}^n\)&lt;/span&gt; suggests what the answer should be even in the more general
cases, at least when the discrete group &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma\)&lt;/span&gt; has a fundamental domain with finite volume,
i.e. when &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma\)&lt;/span&gt; is a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(discrete_subgroup)"&gt;lattice&lt;/a&gt;. In the
case when one is working in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbb{H}^n\)&lt;/span&gt;, the asymptotics are the same.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$ C(r) \sim
\frac{\text{Area}(B(x, r))}{\text{Area}(\text{Fundamental domain})} $$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; One might try the same proof
as before, and it almost works except that it fails at a rather critical step.  Recall that the
volume of a ball of radius &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(r\)&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbb{H}^n\)&lt;/span&gt; is not polynomial in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(r\)&lt;/span&gt;, but rather exponential.
To be more specific, the volume is proportional to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(e^r\)&lt;/span&gt;, which means the following ratio
does not converge to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(1\)&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
\frac{\text{Area}(x, r+1)}{\text{Area}(x, r-1)}
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To be more precise, the thing that can go wrong is the following: by estimating the number of lattice points
as &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(c \cdot \text{Area}(B(x,r))\)&lt;/span&gt; (where &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(c = \frac{1}{\text{Area}(\text{Fundamental domain})}\)&lt;/span&gt;), we may
drastically over count or under count, as the following pictures illustrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="image"&gt;
&lt;caption align="bottom"&gt;Figure 2: This is an underestimate because even though the blue orbit points are in the ball,
most of their fundamental domains aren't, which leads to an underestimate by the area calculation/&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="../images/orbit-points-1/under_estimate.png" width="70%" height="auto" class="center"/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;table class="image"&gt;
&lt;caption align="bottom"&gt;Figure 3: This is an overestimate because even though the blue orbit points are outside the ball,
most of their fundamental domains are in the ball, which leads to an overestimate by the area calculation/&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="../images/orbit-points-1/over_estimate.png" width="70%" height="auto" class="center"/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, these are the worst case scenarios. In a more realistic scenario, one might expect the
overestimates and underestimates to cancel out as the ball gets larger and larger. One might expect
that to happen if the direction at which the boundary of the ball approaches translates of the
fundamental domain is approximately random, and independent of the directions it approaches other
translates by. That turns out to be true, and is a consequence of the fact that the geodesic flow on
hyperbolic surfaces of finite volume is
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixing_(mathematics)#Mixing_in_dynamical_systems"&gt;mixing&lt;/a&gt;.
This intuition is formalized in the following lemma from a paper by Eskin and McMullen&lt;sup id="fnref:paper1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:paper1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lemma:&lt;/strong&gt; Let &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(X = \Gamma/\mathbb{H}^2\)&lt;/span&gt; be a finite volume hyperbolic surface, and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(S(p, r)\)&lt;/span&gt; be the image
of a sphere of radius &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(r\)&lt;/span&gt; on &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbb{H}^2\)&lt;/span&gt; with centre a lift of a point &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma/\mathbb{H}^2\)&lt;/span&gt;.
Then for any compactly supported continuous function &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\alpha\)&lt;/span&gt;, the average of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\alpha\)&lt;/span&gt; over &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(S(p, r)\)&lt;/span&gt; (with
respect to the Lebesgue measure on &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(S^1\)&lt;/span&gt;) approaches the average of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\alpha\)&lt;/span&gt; over &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(X\)&lt;/span&gt; as
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(r\)&lt;/span&gt; approaches &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\infty\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof:&lt;/strong&gt; To prove this result, we need to lift the function &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\alpha\)&lt;/span&gt; to the unit tangent bundle
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(T^1X\)&lt;/span&gt;, and we do that in the obvious way, i.e. &lt;span class="math"&gt;\({\alpha}(x, v) = \alpha(x)\)&lt;/span&gt;, for any unit tangent
vector &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(v\)&lt;/span&gt; over &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt;. Also, let &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(K\)&lt;/span&gt; be the set of all vectors over &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;. Then the image of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(K\)&lt;/span&gt; under
the geodesic flow &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(g_t\)&lt;/span&gt; is the collection of vectors over &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(S(p, t)\)&lt;/span&gt; pointing normally outwards. In
particular, the average of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\alpha\)&lt;/span&gt; over &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(S(p, t)\)&lt;/span&gt; is the same as the average of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\alpha\)&lt;/span&gt; over
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(g_t(K)\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:observation"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:observation"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(g_t(K)\)&lt;/span&gt; can be approximated arbitrarily well by &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(g_t(U)\)&lt;/span&gt; where
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(U\)&lt;/span&gt; is the collection of vectors over a small neighbourhood of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;. Because the geodesic flow is
mixing, the average of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\alpha\)&lt;/span&gt; over &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(g_t(U)\)&lt;/span&gt; approaches the average of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\alpha\)&lt;/span&gt; over &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(S^1X\)&lt;/span&gt; (and
equivalently, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(X\)&lt;/span&gt;), as &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(t\)&lt;/span&gt; approaches &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\infty\)&lt;/span&gt;. This proves the result. &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\square\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have the lemma, the rest is smooth sailing. We let &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\alpha\)&lt;/span&gt; be a bump function supported in
a small neighbourhood of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;, and lift &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\alpha\)&lt;/span&gt; to a function &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\widetilde{\alpha}\)&lt;/span&gt; on the universal
cover. To count the number of orbit points in a ball of radius &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(r\)&lt;/span&gt;, we just integrate
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\widetilde{\alpha}\)&lt;/span&gt; on that ball. We can approximate this integral for large &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(r\)&lt;/span&gt; using the lemma we
just proved, and that gives us the estimate we want, namely that the number of orbit points in a
ball of radius &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(r\)&lt;/span&gt; is asymptotically &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{\text{Area}(B(p, r))}{\text{Area}(\text{Fundamental
Domain})}\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the key elements of this proof was the fact that the geodesic flow is mixing with respect to
a suitable measure. That suggests how one might extend this idea to other contexts. One important
generalization of cocompact lattices are convex cocompact groups&lt;sup id="fnref:convex"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:convex"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. And for these groups, the
estimates we have here don't work verbatim because the fundamental domain for a convex cocompact
group may not have finite area. Secondly, the lemma as stated won't work either because the
Liouville measure is not the "correct" measure on the unit tangent bundle. Not only is it not
mixing, it's not even preserved by geodesic flow. In fact, the geodesic flow makes all the
mass of Liouville measure escape the convex core, which means that one cannot do dynamics on a convex cocompact
group using the Liouville measure. The right measure for this context turns out to be the Bowen-Margulis measure,
which is constructed using the Patterson-Sullivan measure on the boundary, and that is what I will write about in
my next blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: &lt;a href="/orbit-points-2.0.html"&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt; of this series is up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:observation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact is fairly obvious in this case because the measure on &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(S^1X\)&lt;/span&gt; is the
Liouville measure, which is locally a product of the Riemannian measure on the base, and
Lebesgue measure on the fibre. However, this fact is no longer obvious if one is dealing with
other measures like the Bowen-Margulis measure, which may not be uniform in every direction.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:observation" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:convex"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convex cocompact groups are discrete groups whose action on the convex hull of its limit set is
cocompact (but its action on the universal cover may not cocompact).&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:convex" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

prove existence of objects before going on to prove any properties about them. After a few years,
this becomes almost second nature, and most pure mathematicians are wary of making claims about any
object without first proving its existence. In practice, physicists and applied mathematicians
aren't held back by such restrictions: they often assume the existence of, say, a solution to a PDE,
and prove results about the solutions, e.g. prove bounds on the size, smoothness, etc. and it often
turns out that the solutions do exist, and satisfy those properties. A priori estimates are the
bounds on the solution one gets before one actually knows the solution exists. Under certain conditions,
one can then use these bounds on the solution to show that a solution exists. Informally, the chain of
logic looks something like the following.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{align*}
(\text{Solution exists} \implies \text{Solution bounded by } C ) \implies \text{Solution exists}
\end{align*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The first implication is the a priori estimate, and the second implication follows from a general
fixed point theorem. We'll see how it works out in practice, but before we see a real example, we'll
see a pseudo-example from algebra which looks similar to an a priori estimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Normality is local&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R\)&lt;/span&gt; be a normal ring. This means that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R\)&lt;/span&gt; is an integral domain such that for any &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\theta \in \text{Frac}(R)\)&lt;/span&gt;,
if &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\theta\)&lt;/span&gt; is a root of a monic polynomial in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R[x]\)&lt;/span&gt;, then &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\theta\)&lt;/span&gt; actually belongs to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R\)&lt;/span&gt;. We want to prove
the following result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theorem:&lt;/strong&gt; If &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R\)&lt;/span&gt; is a normal ring, and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f\)&lt;/span&gt; is a non-zero element of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R\)&lt;/span&gt;, then the localization &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f^{-1}R\)&lt;/span&gt;
is also normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\theta\)&lt;/span&gt; is some element in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\text{Frac}(f^{-1}R)\)&lt;/span&gt; which satisfies a monic polynomial
in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f^{-1}R[x]\)&lt;/span&gt;. Notice that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\text{Frac}(f^{-1}R) = \text{Frac}(R)\)&lt;/span&gt;, so &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\theta\)&lt;/span&gt; can be thought
of belonging to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\text{Frac}(R)\)&lt;/span&gt;. Elements of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f^{-1}R\)&lt;/span&gt; are of the form &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{r}{f^k}\)&lt;/span&gt;, where &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(r \in R\)&lt;/span&gt;,
and we can also assume &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(k\)&lt;/span&gt; is the minimal exponent, i.e. &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(r\)&lt;/span&gt; is not a multiple of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f\)&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R\)&lt;/span&gt;. One can think
of the exponent &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(k\)&lt;/span&gt; as a kind of norm on elements of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f^{-1}R\)&lt;/span&gt;. Let &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\theta\)&lt;/span&gt; be a root of the following
monic polynomial.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{align*}
x^n + \frac{r_{n-1}}{f^{k_{n-1}}}x^{n-1} + \cdots + \frac{r_{1}}{f^{k_{1}}}x + \frac{r_{0}}{f^{k_{0}}}
\end{align*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We need to show that this equation has a solution in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f^{-1}R\)&lt;/span&gt;, in particular, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\theta \in f^{-1}\)&lt;/span&gt;.
In the spirit of a priori estimates, let's assume that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\theta\)&lt;/span&gt; is a solution that actually lies
in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f^{-1}R\)&lt;/span&gt;. We'll try to get a bound on the norm of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\theta\)&lt;/span&gt;, i.e. an a priori estimate. Let &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\theta\)&lt;/span&gt;
be of the form &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{\alpha}{f^k}\)&lt;/span&gt;. We want to plug &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{\alpha}{f^k}\)&lt;/span&gt; into the given polynomial and get
a monic polynomial in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R[\alpha]\)&lt;/span&gt;, since &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R\)&lt;/span&gt; is normal. If we plug in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{\alpha}{f^k}\)&lt;/span&gt;, we get the following.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{align*}
    \frac{1}{f^{nk}}\alpha^{n} + \frac{r_{n-1}}{f^{k_{n-1} +nk - k}} \alpha^{n-1} +
    \frac{r_{n-2}}{f^{k_{n-2} +nk - 2k}} \alpha^{n-2} + \cdots +  \frac{r_{1}}{f^{k_{1} +nk - (n-1)k}} \alpha^{1} +
    \frac{r_0}{f^{k_0}} = 0
\end{align*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we want to clear denominators, and still retain a monic polynomial, our &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(k\)&lt;/span&gt; must satisfy the following inequalities
for all &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(1 \leq j \leq n\)&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{align*}
    k \geq \frac{k_{n-j}}{j}
\end{align*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These inequalities are our a priori estimates. We assumed that the solution existed, and we then bounded its norm below
by a fixed quantity. Now we need to show that this implies a solution exists. Notice that after clearing the denominator,
we get a monic polynomial in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R[x]\)&lt;/span&gt; which is satisfies by &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\alpha = f^k \theta\)&lt;/span&gt; which belongs to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\text{Frac}(R)\)&lt;/span&gt;. Since
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R\)&lt;/span&gt; is normal, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\alpha \in R\)&lt;/span&gt;, and hence &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\theta = \frac{\alpha}{f^k}\)&lt;/span&gt; is in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f^{-1}R\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pseudo-example served two purposes: the first one was elucidate the key idea behind using a priori estimates without
getting bogged into analytic technicalities. The second purpose was to illustrate that the idea of boundedness implying
existence might be a very broad principle that applies in a lot of contexts. Now we'll see an actual example of
using an priori estimate. This is Example 2 from Chapter 9 of Evans' &lt;em&gt;Partial Differential Equations&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A quasilinear elliptic PDE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider a region &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(U\)&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbb{R}^n\)&lt;/span&gt; with a smooth boundary &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\partial U\)&lt;/span&gt;. We want to solve
the following PDE.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{align*}
    - \Delta u + \mu u = -b(Du)
\end{align*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Additionally, we have that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(u\)&lt;/span&gt; must be &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(0\)&lt;/span&gt; on the
boundary. In the above equation, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Delta\)&lt;/span&gt; is the Laplacian, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mu\)&lt;/span&gt; some number greater than &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(0\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(b\)&lt;/span&gt;
is a Lipschitz function, and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(D\)&lt;/span&gt; is a first order partial differential operator. We want to show
that for a large enough &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mu\)&lt;/span&gt; there exists a solution &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(u \in H^2(U) \cap H^1_0(U)\)&lt;/span&gt;, where &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(H^2\)&lt;/span&gt; and
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(H^1_0\)&lt;/span&gt; are the appropriate Sobolev spaces (if you don't know what Sobolev spaces are, think of
these spaces as functions whose derivatives are bounded).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(w \in H^1_0(U)\)&lt;/span&gt;, define &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f_w\)&lt;/span&gt; to be the function &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(-b(Dw)\)&lt;/span&gt;. Since &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(b\)&lt;/span&gt; is Lipschitz, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f_w\)&lt;/span&gt; is in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(L^2\)&lt;/span&gt;.
If we plug in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f_w\)&lt;/span&gt; instead of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(-b(Du)\)&lt;/span&gt; in the PDE, we have the following linear PDE (after fixing &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(w\)&lt;/span&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{align*}
    - \Delta u + \mu u = f_w
\end{align*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
By general PDE theory, linear elliptic PDEs have unique
solutions. Let the solution we get be denoted by &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(u_w\)&lt;/span&gt;.  By more general nonsense (i.e. elliptic
regularity and similar statements), we have that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(u_w\)&lt;/span&gt; is in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(H^2(U)\)&lt;/span&gt;.  We thus have a map that
takes &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(w \in H^1_0(U)\)&lt;/span&gt; to a &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(u_w\)&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(H^2\)&lt;/span&gt;. This can also be thought of as a non-linear continuous
map from &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(H^1_0(U)\)&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(H^1_0(U)\)&lt;/span&gt;. We call this map &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(A\)&lt;/span&gt;, and we can bound the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(H^2\)&lt;/span&gt; norm of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(A\)&lt;/span&gt;. The
Rellich lemma tells us that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(A\)&lt;/span&gt; takes bounded sets to pre-compact sets in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(H^1_0\)&lt;/span&gt;. After some more
analysis, which we'll skip, we can show that for a large enough &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mu\)&lt;/span&gt;, the following set is bounded.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{align*}
SFP = \{ w \in H^1_0(U)\ |\ w = \lambda A(w) \text{ for some $\lambda \in [0,1]$} \}
\end{align*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Observe that any &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(w\)&lt;/span&gt; such that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(w = A(w)\)&lt;/span&gt; will be a solution of our original PDE. That means
we would like to show that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(A\)&lt;/span&gt; has fixed points. What we have from our analysis so far is
that the set of scaled fixed points &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(SFP\)&lt;/span&gt; is bounded. This is our a priori estimate. The second
step is applying Schaefer's fixed point theorem to the map &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(A\)&lt;/span&gt;, which requires the set &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(SFP\)&lt;/span&gt; be bounded,
and gives us that the map &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(A\)&lt;/span&gt; has a fixed point, and hence our original PDE has a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both the examples, the idea of the proof was guided by the following principle: pretend a solution exists to get
bounds, and after obtaining those bounds, show that a solution actually exists.&lt;/p&gt;

math. Not surprisingly, the list included the usual suspects like &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;simple&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;regular&lt;/em&gt;.
It's probably the same reason that these words also make it to the top five of &lt;a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/7389/what-are-the-most-overloaded-words-in-mathematics"&gt;this MathOverflow
post&lt;/a&gt;. These
words are overloaded to the point of meaning something different to mathematicians working in
different areas of math. On the other hand, we all agreed that some overloading of words was
actually fairly useful: for instance, it makes sense to call a normal covering space normal since it
actually corresponds to a normal subgroup of the fundamental group.  That means calling a cover
normal and calling a subgroup normal isn't really a bad thing, since it shows that those two notions
are related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We thought we'd do something similar for all the possible meanings of the word normal: we'd define
an equivalence relation between two different meanings if there is some result, deep or otherwise,
that links the two notions. Then the number of equivalence classes we get would be a much better
metric of the overloaded-ness of the word &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a list of the meanings of &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt; (taken from Wikipedia), along with some additions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normal subgroup&lt;/strong&gt;: A subgroup which is invariant under conjugation action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normal cover&lt;/strong&gt;: A covering space whose deck transformation group acts transitively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normal field extension&lt;/strong&gt;: A field extension such that every irreducible polynomial in the base
   field splits into linear factor, or is irreducible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These three uses of normal are really the same, since they all talk about an associated subgroup
being a normal subgroup. In the case of the normal cover, the fundamental group of the cover is a
normal subgroup of the fundamental group of the base space. When it comes to field extensions,
consider the following field extension: &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(E \subset F \subset G\)&lt;/span&gt;, where &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(G\)&lt;/span&gt; is Galois over &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(E\)&lt;/span&gt;.  In
this case, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(F\)&lt;/span&gt; is a normal extension iff it corresponds to a normal subgroup of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathrm{Gal}(E/G)\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few different meanings of the word normal(ize) show up often in algebraic geometry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normal domain&lt;/strong&gt;: An integral domain which is integrally closed in its field of fractions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normal varieties&lt;/strong&gt;: A variety &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(X\)&lt;/span&gt; such that any finite birational map from any variety &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(Y\)&lt;/span&gt; to
  &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(X\)&lt;/span&gt; is an isomorphism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noether normalization&lt;/strong&gt;: The Noether normalization lemma states that for any finitely generated
  &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(k\)&lt;/span&gt;-algebra &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(A\)&lt;/span&gt;, there exist &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\{y_1, \ldots, y_d\} \in A\)&lt;/span&gt; such that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(A\)&lt;/span&gt; is a finitely generated
  module over &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(k[y_1, \ldots, y_d]\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These seemingly different notions actually are somewhat equivalent. As it turns out, a variety is
normal if the local ring at every point is integrally closed. And while normal varieties are
varieties which have maps from "nice" varieties, a geometric interpretation of Noether normalization
is that every &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(d\)&lt;/span&gt;-dimensional affine variety is a ramified cover of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbb{A}^d\)&lt;/span&gt;, which is a "nice"
variety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another meaning of the word normal comes from the geometric notion of being perpendicular. This
gives us a lot of different meanings of the word normal which we can collapse to one equivalence
class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normal bundle&lt;/strong&gt;: The normal bundle of an embedded submanifold is the vector bundle such that the
  fibre over each point consists of vectors perpendicular to the tangent space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normal coordinates&lt;/strong&gt;: Given a vector bundle with an affine connection, the normal coordinates
  around a point are coordinates such that the Christoffel symbols of the connection vanish at the
  point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Ortho)normal basis&lt;/strong&gt;: A basis of an inner product space such that each vector is of norm &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(1\)&lt;/span&gt; and
  every pair is perpendicular.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normal operator&lt;/strong&gt;: An operator which commutes with its Hermitian conjugate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normal modes&lt;/strong&gt;: (Taken from wikipedia) A normal mode of an oscillating system is a pattern of
  motion in which all parts of the system move sinusoidally with the same frequency and with a fixed
  phase relation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normal bundle literally comes from the original meaning of the word normal in the sense of being
perpendicular. Normal coordinates also come from the same source: in the case of the Levi-Civita
connection, one gets a set of normal coordinates by applying the exponential map to an orthonormal
basis of the tangent space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason why a normal operator is called a normal operator is that we know from the spectral
theorem that its eigenvalues form an orthonormal basis. That is also the source of normal modes. The
"normal" in normal modes comes from the fact that the vibrations are the eigenvectors of a certain
differential operator, which happens to be self-adjoint, hence normal. That means all the normal
modes literally form an orthonormal basis of solutions to the associated PDE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above words were some of the different cases of the usage of the word &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt; that we were able
to collapse.  And below are the ones we couldn't collapse to anything else, so they sit all by
themselves (for now) in their own equivalence class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normal family&lt;/strong&gt;: A pre-compact family of holomorphic functions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normal space&lt;/strong&gt;: A topological space which satisfies the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(T_4\)&lt;/span&gt; axiom. &lt;a href="http://brownsharpie.courtneygibbons.org/comic/i-used-to-confuse-regular-and-normal/"&gt;Here's a bad pun&lt;/a&gt; involving this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normal forms&lt;/strong&gt;: These are a whole class of ways to write matrices of linear operators in a nice form,
  e.g. Jordan normal form, Smith normal form, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normal distribution&lt;/strong&gt;: The distribution that most sums of random variables converge to, thanks to the
  Central limit theorem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normal forms part deux&lt;/strong&gt;: All the normal forms that crop up in formal language theory and
  computability, e.g. conjunctive normal form, disjunctive normal form, Chomsky normal form, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started off with 18 different meanings of the word &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt;, and now, after constructing the
equivalence relation, we are left with only 8 different equivalence classes (maybe fewer, if someone
discovers some deep result linking normal operators to normal subgroups). That makes one think: maybe
it's not so ab&lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt; for mathematicians to overuse normal after all.&lt;/p&gt;

lot.  I've learnt a few things about varieties, and also a bit of commutative
algebra, but the most important takeaway for me from the first week was the
sheaf theoretic way of looking at smooth manifolds (and also algebraic
varieties). I'll talk a bit about this approach of looking at things, and then
outline a definition of cotangent space using this formalism, and see how that
lets us define a cotangent space on algebraic varieties. Finally, we'll have some sanity
checks on the defined cotangent space to see if some properties carry over to
the category of algebraic varieties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The sheaf of regular functions on a topological space&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's consider a specific example: consider some smooth manifold &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M\)&lt;/span&gt;. For any
open subset &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(U\)&lt;/span&gt;, consider the set &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{O}(U)\)&lt;/span&gt; of all smooth functions from
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(U\)&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbb{R}\)&lt;/span&gt;.  We have such a collection for each open subset of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M\)&lt;/span&gt;. But
that's not all - we have relations between the various &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{O}(U)\)&lt;/span&gt;. If &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(U
\subset V\)&lt;/span&gt;, then there's a natural map from &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{O}(V)\)&lt;/span&gt; to
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{O}(U)\)&lt;/span&gt;, which is the restriction map. Now recall that we are working
with smooth functions: one property of smoothness is that it's a local
property. To put it more concretely, if we have &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; map from an open set &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(U\)&lt;/span&gt;
to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbb{R}\)&lt;/span&gt; such that its restriction to each open subset &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(U_i\)&lt;/span&gt; is smooth,
where &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\{U_i\}\)&lt;/span&gt; is some collection of open subsets that covers &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(U\)&lt;/span&gt;, then we know
that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(U\)&lt;/span&gt; is actually smooth. Phrasing this in terms of the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{O}(U)\)&lt;/span&gt;
formalism, it just means that if the restriction of a function &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f\)&lt;/span&gt; to each &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(U_i\)&lt;/span&gt;
is contained in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{O}(U_i)\)&lt;/span&gt;, then &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f\)&lt;/span&gt; is actually in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{O}(U)\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two properties make the collection &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\{\mathcal{O}(U)\}\)&lt;/span&gt; into
a sheaf. Furthermore, the set &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{O}(U)\)&lt;/span&gt; can be given the structure
of an algebra, because the maps are all into a ring, and hence the functions can
be added and multiplied pointwise, and multiplied by elements of the ring
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R\)&lt;/span&gt;. And if we vary the space &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(X\)&lt;/span&gt;, the ring &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R\)&lt;/span&gt;, and the sets &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{O}(U)\)&lt;/span&gt;,
we end up getting various familiar spaces and maps. For instance, if we keep &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(X\)&lt;/span&gt;
as a manifold, and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R\)&lt;/span&gt; as &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbb{R}\)&lt;/span&gt;, but require &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{O}(U)\)&lt;/span&gt; to the
collection of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(C^1\)&lt;/span&gt; functions, we end up getting a &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(C^1\)&lt;/span&gt; manifold. If we set &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(X\)&lt;/span&gt;
as a some affine variety over a field &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(k\)&lt;/span&gt;, set &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R\)&lt;/span&gt; as &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(k\)&lt;/span&gt;, and set
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{O}(U)\)&lt;/span&gt; as the ratio of polynomials where the denominator does not
vanish on the set &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(U\)&lt;/span&gt;, we get the regular functions of affine varieties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sheaves are a nice way of capturing functions which satisfy some property
&lt;em&gt;locally&lt;/em&gt;, whether it is being smooth, being holomorphic, or being ratios of
polynomials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sheaves capture local properties&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider a topological space &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(X\)&lt;/span&gt; and the sheaf of regular functions
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{O}\)&lt;/span&gt; to a field &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(k\)&lt;/span&gt;, and some point &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p \in X\)&lt;/span&gt;.  With the sheaves, we
have a way of looking at the &lt;em&gt;germ&lt;/em&gt; of any function &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f\)&lt;/span&gt; at the point &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;.  It's
clear that the germ of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f\)&lt;/span&gt; will capture all the local information of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f\)&lt;/span&gt; at that
point.  For instance, when the regular functions are smooth functions, the germ
of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f\)&lt;/span&gt; will contain the information about all the derivatives of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f\)&lt;/span&gt;. If the
regular functions are holomorphic functions, the germ contains even &lt;em&gt;global&lt;/em&gt;
information about the function because of analytic continuation.  The collection
of the germs of all the functions defined around &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;, called the stalk at &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;, is
again a &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(k\)&lt;/span&gt;-algebra. It is much more, in fact. It's a local ring (which we'll
call &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{O}_p\)&lt;/span&gt;), whose only maximal ideal is the set of germs of all the functions
which vanish at &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way of getting local information at the point &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt; is to look at tangent vectors
at the point &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;. What do tangent vectors mean in this context though? A tangent vector
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(v\)&lt;/span&gt; at &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt; is a &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(k\)&lt;/span&gt;-linear map from the set of all functions defined in some open set
around &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(k\)&lt;/span&gt; such that for any two functions &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(g\)&lt;/span&gt;, the
product rule holds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{align*}
v(fg) = f(p) \cdot v(g) + v(f) \cdot g(p)
\end{align*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It's not quite clear from the definition whether the action of the tangent vector
on a function &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f\)&lt;/span&gt; depends only the germ of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f\)&lt;/span&gt;. In fact, even the relation between
the tangent space, and the local ring at &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt; is not very clear from this definition.
We need some way to link the two notions. And that's where the cotangent space comes
in. We shall define the cotangent space in purely algebraic terms, i.e. in terms of the
local ring, and then show that the space of tangent vectors &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(T_p\)&lt;/span&gt; is actually the dual of
the cotangent space, thus exhibiting the link between the local ring at &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;, to the
tangent space at &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Construction of the algebraic cotangent space&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathfrak{m}\)&lt;/span&gt; be the maximal ideal of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{O}_p\)&lt;/span&gt;. It consists of the
germs of all the functions which vanish at &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;. We define the cotangent space at
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt; to be the set &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{\mathfrak{m}}{\mathfrak{m}^2}\)&lt;/span&gt; considered as a &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(k\)&lt;/span&gt;
vector space. I won't outline the motivation behind picking this as the
cotangent space, because I myself am not completely sure why, so let's take for
granted that this is a reasonable candidate for the definition of cotangent
space. We need to show that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(T_p\)&lt;/span&gt; is the dual of the space
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{\mathfrak{m}}{\mathfrak{m}^2}\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we'll show every element of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(T_p\)&lt;/span&gt; is indeed a linear functional acting on
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{\mathfrak{m}}{\mathfrak{m}^2}\)&lt;/span&gt;. Take any element &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(v \in T_p\)&lt;/span&gt;. It acts
on an element &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(m + \mathfrak{m}^2\)&lt;/span&gt;, and returns &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(v(m)\)&lt;/span&gt;. This map is well defined,
because for any other representative &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(m'\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(m - m' \in \mathfrak{m}^2\)&lt;/span&gt;, i.e. it is
of the form &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(m_1 m_2\)&lt;/span&gt; for &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(m_1\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(m_2\)&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathfrak{m}\)&lt;/span&gt;. Using the identity
for tangent vectors, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(v(m_1m_2)\)&lt;/span&gt; is given by &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(m_1(p)v(m_2) + v(m_1)m_2(p)\)&lt;/span&gt;, and
both the terms are &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(0\)&lt;/span&gt;, since elements of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathfrak{m}\)&lt;/span&gt; evaluate to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(0\)&lt;/span&gt; at &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we'll show any linear functional &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(w\)&lt;/span&gt; acting on
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{\mathfrak{m}}{\mathfrak{m}^2}\)&lt;/span&gt; gives a tangent vector &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(t_w\)&lt;/span&gt;. We define
the action of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(t_w\)&lt;/span&gt; on any function &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f\)&lt;/span&gt; as the value of the functional &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(w\)&lt;/span&gt; on
the function &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\overline{f}(x) = f(x) - f(p)\)&lt;/span&gt;. The function &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\overline{f}\)&lt;/span&gt; vanishes at &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(0\)&lt;/span&gt;, and hence it
belongs to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathfrak{m}\)&lt;/span&gt;. All we need to do is check whether it satisfies the
product rule.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{align*}
t_w(f(x)g(x)) &amp;amp;= w(\overline{f(x)g(x)}) \\
&amp;amp;= w(f(x)g(x) - f(p)g(p)) \\
&amp;amp;= w(f(x)g(x) - f(x)g(p) + f(x)g(p) - f(p)g(p)) \\
&amp;amp;= w(f(x)(g(x) - g(p))) + g(p) w(f(x) - f(p)) \\
&amp;amp;= w((f(x) - f(p))(g(x) - g(p)) + f(p)(g(x) - g(p))) + g(p) w(f(x) - f(p)) \\
&amp;amp;= 0 + f(p)t_w(g) + t_w(f)g(p)
\end{align*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This proves the duality, and gives us a link between the tangent space and the local ring.
In the case of smooth manifolds, this tells us that the cotangent space defined using the local
ring is really the same as the cotangent space defined in the usual differential geometric way.
What isn't immediately clear is how the cotangent bundle is defined, and this is something I'll
come back to later. The advantage of this construction is that the same construction goes through
for algebraic varieties. Whether this is a useful notion or not in the case of algebraic varieties
is a question that needs to be answered. But before that, we should do a sanity check. In the case
of smooth manifolds, we had the dimension of the cotangent space at every point to be the dimension
of the manifold. It's reasonable to expect that this also happens in the case of algebraic manifolds.
And that is indeed the case, and we'll see a simple proof of the fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dimension of cotangent space is the same as the dimension of algebraic variety&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we prove the result, let's qualify the statement a little more. First of
all, it suffices to prove the result for affine varieties, since both the
cotangent space and the dimension of the variety are essentially local
properties. Secondly, varieties can have bad points, i.e. singularities, where
they intersect themselves, or there's a sharp bend of some sort (e.g. the
variety in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbb{A}^2_{\mathbb{C}}\)&lt;/span&gt; defined by &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(X^3 - Y^2\)&lt;/span&gt;). We want to avoid
those points. Thankfully, there's a nice algebraic description of the
non-singular points. A point &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt; is non-singular if the local ring
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{O}_p\)&lt;/span&gt; at &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt; is regular, i.e. the maximal ideal is generated by &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(d\)&lt;/span&gt;
elements, where &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(d\)&lt;/span&gt; is the dimension of the variety. With this algebraic description in hand,
our task now reduces to proving the following proposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proposition.&lt;/strong&gt; Suppose &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(A\)&lt;/span&gt; is a Noetherian &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(k\)&lt;/span&gt;-algebra, which is also a local ring whose
maximal ideal &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathfrak{m}\)&lt;/span&gt; is generated by &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(d\)&lt;/span&gt; elements &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\{f_1, \ldots, f_d\}\)&lt;/span&gt;, where &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(d\)&lt;/span&gt;
is the Krull dimension of the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(k\)&lt;/span&gt;-algebra. Then the dimension of the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(k\)&lt;/span&gt;-vector space
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{\mathfrak{m}}{\mathfrak{m}^2}\)&lt;/span&gt; is also &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(d\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof.&lt;/strong&gt; Consider any element &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(g\)&lt;/span&gt; in the ideal &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathfrak{m}\)&lt;/span&gt;. Since it's Noetherian and local, we can
write &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(g\)&lt;/span&gt; in the following manner,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{align*}
g = \sum_j c_j (f_1)^{p_{1j}} \cdots (f_d)^{p_{dj}}
\end{align*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
where &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(c_j\)&lt;/span&gt; don't belong to the ideal &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathfrak{m}\)&lt;/span&gt;, and for all &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(j\)&lt;/span&gt;, some &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p_{ij}\)&lt;/span&gt; some greater
than &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(0\)&lt;/span&gt;. Quotienting by &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathfrak{m}^2\)&lt;/span&gt;, all the terms with the higher powers of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f_i\)&lt;/span&gt; become &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(0\)&lt;/span&gt;,
and the representative in the quotient looks like the following.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{align*}
\overline{g} = \sum_{i}^{d} c_i f_i
\end{align*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With this expression, it's easy to see what the map to the space &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(k^d\)&lt;/span&gt; is. Send &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\overline{g}\)&lt;/span&gt; to the vector
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\((c_1(p), c_2(p), \ldots, c_d(p))\)&lt;/span&gt;. But is this map well defined? What if we also have another
representative &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\overline{g}' = \sum c_i'f_i\)&lt;/span&gt;. But in that case, each of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(c_i - c_i'\)&lt;/span&gt; must belong
to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathfrak{m}\)&lt;/span&gt;, hence &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(c_i(p) = c_i'(p)\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's now construct a map from &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(k^d\)&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{\mathfrak{m}}{\mathfrak{m}^2}\)&lt;/span&gt;. Send the vector
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\((c_1, \ldots, c_d)\)&lt;/span&gt; to the element &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\sum c_i f_i\)&lt;/span&gt;. It's easy to see this map is well defined,
and the inverse of the previous map. This proves the result.
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\blacksquare\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cotangent space manages to pass at least this rudimentary sanity check, which makes it a little easier
to believe that this is the right notion of the cotangent space on a variety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given a manifold &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M\)&lt;/span&gt;, one way to study vector bundles over &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M\)&lt;/span&gt; is to use the theory of
characteristic classes. A characteristic class is a way of assigning to each vector bundle over &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M\)&lt;/span&gt;
an element of the cohomology ring &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(H^{\ast}(M, G)\)&lt;/span&gt;. This assignment is not just any arbitrary
assignment; it has to satisfy a &lt;em&gt;naturality&lt;/em&gt; condition. If &lt;span class="math"&gt;\((F, N, \pi_2)\)&lt;/span&gt; is a vector
bundle, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f: M \to N\)&lt;/span&gt; is a smooth map, (E, M, \pi_1) is the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pullback_bundle"&gt;pullback bundle&lt;/a&gt;,
and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(c(E)\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(c(F)\)&lt;/span&gt; are the cohomology classes assigned to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(E\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(F\)&lt;/span&gt; by the characteristic class
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(c\)&lt;/span&gt;, then the pullback of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(c(F)\)&lt;/span&gt; along the map &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f\)&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(c(E)\)&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{align*}
c(E) = f^{\ast}(c(F))
\end{align*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The naturality condition is what makes characteristic classes so useful: it tells us that
characteristic classes are an invariant of vector bundles over a manifold. If two vector
bundles are isomorphic, they'll get assigned the same characteristic class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step in studying characteristic classes is to construct interesting examples of them.
Its definition is certainly not of much help in actually constructing any examples. In fact,
constructing characteristic classes is not entirely trivial, and requires some work. We'll look
at one way of constructing characteristic classes, called Chern classes. This construction
is quite non-trivial, and requires the use of differential geometric machinery. The advantage of this
construction however, is that it gives an explicit way of constructing characteristic classes over
a lot of familiar vector bundles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Connections on vector bundles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given a rank &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(k\)&lt;/span&gt; vector bundle &lt;span class="math"&gt;\((E, M)\)&lt;/span&gt;, a connection on the vector bundle is a bundle map &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\nabla\)&lt;/span&gt; from
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(E\)&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(E \otimes T^{\ast}M\)&lt;/span&gt; which satisfies the following condition for all smooth real-valued functions &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f\)&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{align*}
\nabla(fv) = v \otimes df + f (\nabla v)
\end{align*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we pick local coordinates and a trivialization around some point in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M\)&lt;/span&gt;, then the connection
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\nabla\)&lt;/span&gt; can be described by a &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(k \times k\)&lt;/span&gt; matrix of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(1\)&lt;/span&gt;-forms, which we'll denote
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(A\)&lt;/span&gt;, where the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(i\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; column
denotes what &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\nabla e_i\)&lt;/span&gt; goes to, where &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\{e_i\}\)&lt;/span&gt; is the local frame for the vector bundle.
The matrix &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(A\)&lt;/span&gt; is often called a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_form"&gt;connection form&lt;/a&gt;.
Using the matrix &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(A\)&lt;/span&gt;, we can construct another matrix, this one consisting of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(2\)&lt;/span&gt;-forms, which we'll call
the curvature form&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{align*}
\Omega = dA + A \wedge A
\end{align*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The curvature form will be the key tool we'll use to construct the Chern classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Constructing globally defined forms using curvature&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nice thing about the curvature form is that it transforms in a particularly
nice manner when one changes the trivialization for the vector bundle. If &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Omega\)&lt;/span&gt;
is the curvature matrix in the old trivialization, and the new trivialization is given
by multiplying by an invertible matrix &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(g\)&lt;/span&gt;, then in the new trivialization, the curvature
matrix is given by &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(g\Omega g^{-1}\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the trace of the curvature matrix defined on some open set. The trace will be
a locally defined &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(2\)&lt;/span&gt;-form. Now recall that for any matrix &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathrm{tr}(M) = \mathrm{tr}(gMg^{-1})\)&lt;/span&gt;.
This means that we can defined a "trace" of the curvature form globally (using a partition of unity argument),
and this gives us a globally defined &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(2\)&lt;/span&gt;-form. In fact, this can be done for any homogeneous
polynomial in the entries of a matrix
which is conjugation invariant, e.g. the determinant. Doing this for the determinant will give
us a globally defined &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(2k\)&lt;/span&gt;-form. We now have a way of constructing globally defined forms
using the curvature form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's take a pause here to recall our goal. We want to associate to each vector bundle over &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M\)&lt;/span&gt;
an element of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(H^{\ast}(M)\)&lt;/span&gt;. What we have done so far is to associate to each vector bundle &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(E\)&lt;/span&gt;
and a choice of connection &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\nabla\)&lt;/span&gt; on that bundle a collection of differential forms. If we manage to show
that the differential form is actually closed, we'll have an assignment of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\((E, \nabla)\)&lt;/span&gt; to an element
of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(H^{\ast}_{DR}(M)\)&lt;/span&gt;. Furthermore, if we show that the assignment to the cohomology class
is independent of which connection we pick, we'll have constructed a characteristic class. In the following
sections, we'll do both of the mentioned things, i.e. show that the globally defined forms are closed,
and their cohomology class is independent of the connection chosen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The globally defined forms are closed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To show that the globally defined forms are closed, we'll need a systematic way of taking
their exterior derivative. The first step in that direction would be to simplify the expression
for the connection form &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(A\)&lt;/span&gt; by picking a nice trivialization. In fact, we can pick a trivialization
in which the connection matrix &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(A\)&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(0\)&lt;/span&gt; at a point. The proof of this fact is outlined in these
&lt;a href="http://www.math.iisc.ac.in/~vamsipingali/6Feb2018.pdf"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; (and some formulae used are derived in these
&lt;a href="http://www.math.iisc.ac.in/~vamsipingali/1Feb2018.pdf"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;). We'll call this trivialization a &lt;em&gt;normal trivialization&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This result already tells us that the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(2\)&lt;/span&gt;-form defined by taking the trace of the curvature is
closed. Pick a normal trivialization around &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;; this makes &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(A\)&lt;/span&gt; vanish at &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;. Then at that point, the curvature
matrix is just &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(dA\)&lt;/span&gt;. The exterior derivative of the trace of this is the same as the trace of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(d^2A\)&lt;/span&gt;
(because the trace is a homogeneous degree &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(1\)&lt;/span&gt; polynomial in the entries of the matrix),
which is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(0\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To extend this idea to homogeneous polynomials of higher degrees, we need some way "linearizing" them,
so that we can take their exterior derivative easily. We do this by &lt;em&gt;polarizing&lt;/em&gt; them. The polarization
of a degree &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(j\)&lt;/span&gt; homogeneous polynomial &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f\)&lt;/span&gt; in the entries of the matrix is a function &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\phi\)&lt;/span&gt; that takes &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(j\)&lt;/span&gt;
matrix arguments, and outputs an element of the algebra over which the matrices are defined. The function &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\phi\)&lt;/span&gt;
is linear in each of its arguments, is symmetric in the order of its arguments, and is conjugation invariant, i.e.
it satisfies the following identity for all invertible matrices &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(g\)&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{align*}
\phi(A_1, \ldots , A_j) = \phi(gA_1g^{-1}, \ldots , gA_jg^{-1})
\end{align*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Furthermore, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\phi\)&lt;/span&gt; must also satisfy the following polarization identity for all matrices &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(A\)&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{align*}
\phi(A, \ldots , A) = f(A)
\end{align*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This last equality is why &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\phi\)&lt;/span&gt; is called the polarization of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f\)&lt;/span&gt;.
Constructing the polarization of a homogeneous degree &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(j\)&lt;/span&gt; polynomial isn't too hard.
The first step is to just construct a multilinear function that satisfies the polarization
identity. One does that by taking each monomial in the expression for &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f\)&lt;/span&gt;, and replacing
the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(i\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; factor by the corresponding factor in the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(i\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is best illustrated by a simple example. Suppose we are working with &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(2 \times 2\)&lt;/span&gt; matrices,
and the polynomial we want to polarize is the determinant polynomial. Its expression is given
in the following manner.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{align*}
f(\{a_{ij}\}) = a_{11}a_{22} - a_{12}a_{21}
\end{align*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Its polarization &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\phi\)&lt;/span&gt; must have two arguments. We'll denote the entries of the first
argument by superscript &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(1\)&lt;/span&gt; and the second by superscript &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(2\)&lt;/span&gt;. Then the first step would
be two write the following expression.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{align*}
a^1_{11}a^2_{22} - a^1_{12}a^2_{21}
\end{align*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever we get in the previous step certainly is multilinear in the arguments and satisfies the
polarization identity. The next step is to symmetrize it. That can be easily done by taking
all permutations of the arguments and taking an average over them. This continues to satisfy
the polarization identity and is multilinear and symmetric. The only thing to do now is to make
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\phi\)&lt;/span&gt; conjugation invariant. But as it turns out, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\phi\)&lt;/span&gt; is already conjugation invariant,
because &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f\)&lt;/span&gt; is conjugation invariant. The proof of this fact is a little tricky,
and is outlined in the next few paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lemma.&lt;/strong&gt; If &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f\)&lt;/span&gt; is a conjugation invariant degree &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(j\)&lt;/span&gt; polynomial in the entries 
of a matrix, and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\phi\)&lt;/span&gt; is its symmetric and multilinear polarization, then &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\phi\)&lt;/span&gt;
is also conjugation invariant (which we'll also call basis invariant).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof:&lt;/strong&gt;     We'll prove this lemma by inducting on the number of distinct matrices in the arguments of
    &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\phi\)&lt;/span&gt;. Observe that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\phi\)&lt;/span&gt; can have at most &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(j\)&lt;/span&gt; distinct matrices as arguments. What we'll show
    is that the following equality holds, when &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\left\{ A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_j\right\}\)&lt;/span&gt; contain at
    most &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(m\)&lt;/span&gt; distinct matrices for each &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(1 \leq m \leq j\)&lt;/span&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{align*}
      \phi\left(gA_1g^{-1}, gA_2g^{-1}, \ldots, gA_jg^{-1}\right)  = \phi\left(A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_j\right)
    \end{align*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Let's start with the base case of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(m=1\)&lt;/span&gt;. This follows from the hypothesis that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f\)&lt;/span&gt; is basis
    invariant, since &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\phi\)&lt;/span&gt; with all identical arguments is just the function &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f\)&lt;/span&gt;. Now suppose we
    have shown the result for some &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(m &amp;lt; j\)&lt;/span&gt;. We now need to show &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\phi\)&lt;/span&gt; is basis invariant when
    supplied with at most &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(m+1\)&lt;/span&gt; different arguments. Pick any set of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(m+1\)&lt;/span&gt; matrices
    &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\left\{A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_{m+1}\right\}\)&lt;/span&gt;, and any invertible matrix &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(g\)&lt;/span&gt;. We want to show the
    following equality (with some of arguments repeated possibly, if &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(m+1 &amp;lt; j\)&lt;/span&gt;).
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{align*}
      \phi\left(gA_1g^{-1}, gA_2g^{-1}, \ldots, gA_{m+1}g^{-1}\right)  = \phi\left(A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_{m+1}\right)
    \end{align*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Consider the following expression, for &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(t \in \mathbb{C}\)&lt;/span&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{align}
      \phi\left( A_1 + tA_{m+1}, A_1 + tA_{m+1}, \ldots, A_1 + tA_{m+1}, A_2, \ldots, A_m \right) \label{eq:1}
    \end{align}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Here, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(A_1 + tA_{m+1}\)&lt;/span&gt; is repeated &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(j -m\)&lt;/span&gt; times. Since expression &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\ref{eq:1}\)&lt;/span&gt; has at most &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(m\)&lt;/span&gt;
    distinct arguments, we can use the induction hypothesis to conclude that expression \ref{eq:1}
    would be the same if we conjugated all arguments with &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(g\)&lt;/span&gt;. In fact, expression \ref{eq:1} can be
    expanded out to be written as a univariate polynomial &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P\)&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(t\)&lt;/span&gt;, with coefficients in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R\)&lt;/span&gt;. The
    coefficient &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(c_j(P)\)&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(t^j\)&lt;/span&gt; in the polynomial is the following.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{align*}
      c_j(P) = \binom{j-m}{j} \phi\left( A_1, \ldots, A_1, A_{m+1}, \ldots, A_{m+1}, A_2, \ldots, A_m\right) 
    \end{align*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Here &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(A_1\)&lt;/span&gt; is repeated &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(j-m - j\)&lt;/span&gt; times, and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(A_{m+1}\)&lt;/span&gt; repeated &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(j\)&lt;/span&gt; times. Similarly, consider
    the polynomial &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P'\)&lt;/span&gt; one gets by expanding out the conjugated version of expression
    \ref{eq:1}. The coefficient &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(c_j(P')\)&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(t^j\)&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P'\)&lt;/span&gt; is given by a similar expression.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{align*}
      c_j(P') = \binom{j-m}{j}
      \phi\left( gA_1g^{-1}, \ldots, gA_1g^{-1}
      , gA_{m+1}g^{-1}, \ldots, gA_{m+1}g^{-1}, gA_2g^{-1}, \ldots, gA_mg^{-1}\right) 
    \end{align*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Recall again that by the induction hypothesis, the polynomials &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P'\)&lt;/span&gt; are the same. Which
    means their coefficients must also be the same. But the coefficients being equal means that even
    if &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\phi\)&lt;/span&gt; has &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(m+1\)&lt;/span&gt; different entries, it's still conjugation invariant, hence proving the
    induction step, and the lemma. &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\blacksquare\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upshot of proving that every homogeneous polynomial can be polarized is that now we
have an easy way of taking exterior derivative. If &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f\)&lt;/span&gt; is the degree &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(j\)&lt;/span&gt; homogeneous polynomial, and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\phi\)&lt;/span&gt; its
polarization, then the exterior derivative of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f(\Omega)\)&lt;/span&gt; is given by the following expression.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{align*}
df(\Omega) = j \cdot \phi(d\Omega, \Omega, \Omega, \ldots , \Omega)
\end{align*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Using normal coordinates, and exploiting the multilinearity of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\phi\)&lt;/span&gt;, we see that every global
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(2\)&lt;/span&gt;-form obtained from the curvature form by applying the polynomial &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f\)&lt;/span&gt; is actually closed,
and hence an element of the cohomology ring. We thus have a way associating a vector bundle
and a connection on it to an element in the cohomology ring. The next step is to show
this assignment is independent of the connection chosen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Independence from choice of connection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given a homogeneous polynomial &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f\)&lt;/span&gt;, and two connections &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\nabla_0\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\nabla_1\)&lt;/span&gt; on the vector
bundle, we need to show the associated forms &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f(\Omega_0)\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f(\Omega_1)\)&lt;/span&gt; differ by an exact
form. Consider the form &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\eta_t = f((1-t)\Omega_0 + (t)\Omega_1)\)&lt;/span&gt;. This defines a path in the
space of forms between f(\Omega_0) and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f(\Omega_1)\)&lt;/span&gt;. If we show &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{d}{dt} \eta_t\)&lt;/span&gt; is exact,
that will show what we wanted to prove. In fact, the exterior derivative of the following
form is precisely &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{d}{dt}\eta_t\)&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{align*}
j \phi \left( A_1 - A_0, \Omega_t, \Omega_t, \ldots, \Omega_t \right)
\end{align*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(A_i\)&lt;/span&gt; is the connection form of the connection &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\nabla_i\)&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Omega_t\)&lt;/span&gt; the curvature
form of the connection &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\nabla_t\)&lt;/span&gt;. If one takes the exterior derivative of this expression, using
the normal coordinates, one can see that it's the same as &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{d}{dt} \eta_t\)&lt;/span&gt;. This proves that 
the choice of connection doesn't matter&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Chern class&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have seen how to construct characteristic classes using the curvature form, we'll
construct a specific example, these are the ones that are called the Chern classes. Let
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(E\)&lt;/span&gt; be a rank &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(k\)&lt;/span&gt; vector bundle, and let &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Omega\)&lt;/span&gt; be the curvature of a chosen connection on &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(E\)&lt;/span&gt;.
Consider the following polynomial in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(t\)&lt;/span&gt;, where &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(t \in \mathbb{R}\)&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{align*}
\det(t\Omega + I) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} f_i(\Omega) t^i
\end{align*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Each of the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f_i(\Omega)\)&lt;/span&gt; are homogeneous degree &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(i\)&lt;/span&gt; polynomials in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Omega\)&lt;/span&gt;. Because
the left hand side is conjugation invariant, so is each of the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f_i(\Omega)\)&lt;/span&gt;. That means
each &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f_i(\Omega)\)&lt;/span&gt; defines an element (of degree &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(2i\)&lt;/span&gt;) in the cohomology ring of the base space &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M\)&lt;/span&gt;.
The &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(i\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Chern class of the vector bundle &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(E\)&lt;/span&gt; is defined to be &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f_i(\Omega)\)&lt;/span&gt;. The previous part 
shows that this is well defined independent of the connection chosen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chern classes satisfy several nice properties, including a product formula
for the Whitney sum of two vector bundles, naturality, etc. The Wikipedia &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chern_class#Construction_of_Chern_classes"&gt;page&lt;/a&gt;
provides a good description, as well as references for further reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason why this is called the curvature form is that in the case of the Levi-Civita
connection on a Riemannian manifold, this definition reduces to the standard Riemann curvature
endomorphism. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature_form#Curvature_form_in_a_vector_bundle"&gt;See this&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This proof of independence from the connection was taken from the problem set &lt;a href="http://math.iisc.ac.in/~vamsipingali/HW43392018.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

who invited me over for the BMS Days (where I had an interview for a PhD position), as well
as the BMS Student Conference which immediately followed the BMS Days. I heard a lot of talks
on very interesting stuff, some of which I want to outline here, just to have an account of it,
if nothing else; this will also serve as a reminder of the areas and results I might want to follow
up on some time in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The math talks (in no particular order)&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll only write about some of the talk; although all of them were fairly interesting,
some were more interesting than others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The computational complexity of query answering under updates (Nicole Schweikardt, HU Berlin)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk outlined the idea of analyzing database systems from the point of view
of computational complexity theory, that is to say, prove effective lower bounds on
the time complexity of querying a database (and to be more specific, time complexity
in terms of only the database size for a fixed query, as well as the in terms of the
complexity of the query and the database size). The query language itself was modelled as
a first order language with a fixed number of atomic predicates depending on the type 
of the database (first order language here means that the atomic predicates maybe negated,
conjuncted, and disjuncted, i.e. NOTed, ANDed, and ORed, and one is also allowed to use
existential and universal qualifiers over elements of the database). This was the general
framework: the results in the presentation however looked at the subclass of queries
(the &lt;em&gt;Conjunctive Queries&lt;/em&gt;) which
only used AND of atomic propositions, and only used the existential qualifiers&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a fixed query, Nicole described a good algorithm and a data structure for the
database such that existence and enumeration of the entries satisfying the queries could
be done reasonably fast, as well as updating the database. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Orbit Closures of Homogeneous Forms (Jesko Hüttenhain, TU Berlin)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk was motivated by the difference between the complexity class #&lt;strong&gt;P&lt;/strong&gt; and the
class &lt;strong&gt;NP&lt;/strong&gt;, which the speaker roughly described as the difference in difficulty between
computing the permanent and the determinant of a given matrix&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It's however only a belief
and not really known whether the former problem is strictly harder than the latter. The speaker
proposed a possible line of attack via algebraic geometry. Consider the determinant function on
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M_n(\mathbb{C})\)&lt;/span&gt;. It is a homogeneous polynomial of degree &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(n^2\)&lt;/span&gt; complex variables,
and it's therefore a point in the space &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbb{C}[x_1, \ldots, x_{n^2}]\)&lt;/span&gt;. We can now look
at the action of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(GL(n, \mathbb{C})\)&lt;/span&gt; on this space defined in the following manner.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$\sigma_A: \det(X) \mapsto \det(AX)$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The orbit defines a subset of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbb{C}[x_1, \ldots, x_{n^2}]\)&lt;/span&gt;, and this subset essentially
corresponds to all the polynomials which are as easy to compute as the determinant. Looking
at the orbit of the permanent polynomial under the same action, we would get the set of polynomials
which are as hard to compute as the permanent is. A way to show the permanent is harder to compute than
the determinant would be to show that the two orbits are different. If one looks at the closure
of the orbits, and shows that they are different, then one would have shown that even approximating
the permanent is hard&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesko then stated one of his results, which characterized the boundary of one such orbit
closure. He also mentioned that this approach to complexity theory might take a while to
bear significant results, as the foundations of this area are being built up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;(Some aspects of) Convexity and curvature (Stephen Lynch, FU Berlin)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk was a presentation of Stephen's recent work (which is also on the 
&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.09697"&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt;). This work generalized convex embeddings
of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(S^n\)&lt;/span&gt; into &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\)&lt;/span&gt; to higher co-dimension embeddings, where the notion
of convexity does not make sense. This was done by replacing the condition of convexity
by an inequality on the second fundamental form, which is exactly equivalent to convexity
in the case of co-dimension &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(1\)&lt;/span&gt;. This sort of inequality, called the pinching condition,
leads to the solution of the mean curvature flow existing for all time, the solution
exhibited further rigidity in the sense that the evolution of time of the sphere is just
homothety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complete list of BMS Student Conference talks is
&lt;a href="https://bmsstudconf.github.io/2018/talks.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and the ones given
at BMS Days are listed &lt;a href="https://www.math-berlin.de/academics/bms-days"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of restriction is quite reminiscent of monotone circuits, and I wondered
whether there was any link between presented results, and lower bounds on monotone
circuits: the speaker however had only chosen this subclass as a simpler problem to tackle
before tackling the problem over the full first order logic. But maybe the results obtained
for the full first order logic might not be as good as the ones of only conjunctive queries.
Perhaps I should have a look at this problem again in the future: some sort of such obstruction
might turn up, and if I were to be even more optimistic, perhaps a direct correspondence between
monotone circuits and conjunctive queries, and general circuits and general queries.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former problem is quite hard, as even computing the permanent of a 0-1 matrix is #&lt;strong&gt;P&lt;/strong&gt;-complete,
and the latter problem is fairly easy, being in the class &lt;strong&gt;P&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sort of approach is a part of the nascent area of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_complexity_theory"&gt;geometric complexity theory&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most introductory algebraic topology courses, cohomology is rather poorly motivated. It's most
commonly seen form in an algebraic topology course is singular cohomology, which arises as a the
homology of the dual of the singular chain complex, but that doesn't really tell you why it's of any
more interest than singular homology, aside from the fact that you get an additional cup product
which you did not have before. However, this approach obscures the geometric meaning of cohomology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A much more intuitive introduction to cohomology turns out to be De Rham cohomology, often
encountered in introductory differential geometry courses. Loosely speaking, De Rham cohomology
measures in how many different ways can a closed form fail to be exact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another cohomology theory we'll look at is sheaf cohomology. Loosely, the cohomology of a sheaf
measures how a certain functor &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma\)&lt;/span&gt;, which we'll define later fails to be an exact functor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of De Rham cohomology, we'll interpret the form being closed as a local property, and it
being exact a global property, and the the case of sheaf cohomology, the exactness of the following
sequence (the exact details of which we'll see in a later section) as a local property.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$0
\rightarrow \mathcal{S}_1 \rightarrow \mathcal{S}_2\rightarrow \mathcal{S}_3 \rightarrow 0$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The
exactness of the sequence we get by applying &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma\)&lt;/span&gt; to the above sequence turns out to be a global
property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both the cases, the cohomology measures how the local property fails to translate to the global
one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;De Rham Cohomology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The De Rham cohomology of a manifold &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M\)&lt;/span&gt; (of dimension &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(m\)&lt;/span&gt;) is the homology of the following of the
following cochain sequence.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$0 \xrightarrow{d} \Lambda^0(M) \xrightarrow{d} \Lambda^1(M)
\xrightarrow{d} \cdots \xrightarrow{d} \Lambda^m(M) \xrightarrow{d} 0$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Here, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Lambda^k(M)\)&lt;/span&gt; is the
space of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(k\)&lt;/span&gt;-forms on &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M\)&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(d\)&lt;/span&gt; is the exterior derivative operator.  For a &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(k\)&lt;/span&gt;-form &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\omega\)&lt;/span&gt; to
be closed, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(d\omega\)&lt;/span&gt; must be &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(0\)&lt;/span&gt;. This is a local property, in the sense that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(d\omega\)&lt;/span&gt; evaluated at
any point &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p \in M\)&lt;/span&gt; depends only on the value of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\omega\)&lt;/span&gt; on any small neighbourhood of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;.  In
fact, one can say a little more, and claim that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(d\omega(p)\)&lt;/span&gt; depends only on the &lt;em&gt;germ&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\omega\)&lt;/span&gt;
at &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;.  If we pick a Euclidean neighbourhood &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(U\)&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt; which is homeomorphic to the open unit
ball, the Poincaré lemma tells us that there is some &lt;span class="math"&gt;\((k+1)\)&lt;/span&gt;-form &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\eta\)&lt;/span&gt; defined on &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(U\)&lt;/span&gt; such that
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\omega = d\eta\)&lt;/span&gt;. In other words, the closed form &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\omega\)&lt;/span&gt; is locally exact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The De Rham cohomology class of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\omega\)&lt;/span&gt; measures how badly does the property of local exactness
fail to translate to global exactness. We can write &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\omega\)&lt;/span&gt; as &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\gamma + d\zeta\)&lt;/span&gt;, where &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\gamma\)&lt;/span&gt; is
the canonical representative of the cohomology class of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\omega\)&lt;/span&gt; (more on this in later posts), and
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\zeta\)&lt;/span&gt; is a &lt;span class="math"&gt;\((k-1)\)&lt;/span&gt;-form. If we stretch the analogy a bit, we can say &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\omega\)&lt;/span&gt; misses being
globally exact by &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\gamma\)&lt;/span&gt; amount. This is the first example of how cohomology measures how badly a
local property fails to be global.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sheaf Cohomology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we see what sort of local to global failure sheaf cohomology measures, we'll quickly define
sheaves and sheaf cohomology, and look at one example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Quick introduction to sheaves&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given a manifold &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M\)&lt;/span&gt; (whatever we discuss will hold in for Hausdorff spaces, and with a little more
work, can be made to work even for a larger class of spaces like spectra of rings), a sheaf
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{S}\)&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(K\)&lt;/span&gt;-modules (&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(K\)&lt;/span&gt; is always assumed to be a commutative ring with identity) over &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M\)&lt;/span&gt;
is a topological space &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{S}\)&lt;/span&gt; with a surjective map &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\pi: \mathcal{S} \to M\)&lt;/span&gt;, such that the
following properties are satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\pi\)&lt;/span&gt; is a local homeomorphism, i.e. for any point &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(s \in \mathcal{S}\)&lt;/span&gt;, there's a neighbourhood
of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(s\)&lt;/span&gt; such that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\pi\)&lt;/span&gt; restricted to that neighbourhood is a homeomorphism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\pi^{-1}(x)\)&lt;/span&gt;, which we'll denote by &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{O}_x\)&lt;/span&gt;, is a &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(K\)&lt;/span&gt;-module, for all &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x \in
M\)&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{O}_x\)&lt;/span&gt; is called the stalk of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{S}\)&lt;/span&gt; at &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The module operations on the stalk are continuous, i.e. if we look at the stalk with the subspace
topology, the module operations of addition and scalar multiplication are continuous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sheaves in some sense a modules parametrized by the space &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M\)&lt;/span&gt;, like vector bundles, but vector
bundles do not satisfy the first condition, unlike sheaves.  The simplest example of a sheaf is the
&lt;em&gt;constant sheaf&lt;/em&gt; which is just &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M \times V\)&lt;/span&gt;, where &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(V\)&lt;/span&gt; is a &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(K\)&lt;/span&gt;-module with the discrete topology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important example is the sheaf of germs of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(C^{\infty}\)&lt;/span&gt; functions on a manifold &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M\)&lt;/span&gt;. For
each &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x \in M\)&lt;/span&gt;, a point in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{O}_x\)&lt;/span&gt; is an equivalence class of functions, the equivalence
relation being that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f \sim g\)&lt;/span&gt; if &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(g\)&lt;/span&gt; agree on some neighbourhood of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt;. This sheaf
deserves a post of its own, and I shall write about it in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last example, which will be key to our goal, is the &lt;em&gt;skyscraper sheaf&lt;/em&gt;. We'll describe it by
first describing the stalk at each point, and then putting an appropriate topology on it. Fix a
point &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x_0 \in M\)&lt;/span&gt;.  The stalk &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{O}_{x_0}\)&lt;/span&gt; at &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x_0\)&lt;/span&gt; will be &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(K\)&lt;/span&gt; as a module over itself. The
stalk at every other point is the zero module. As a set, our sheaf is the following.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$\mathcal{S}
= K \sqcup \bigsqcup_{x \neq x_0} \{0\}$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The question is what topology do we put on this space. The
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Hausdorff_manifold#Line_with_two_origins"&gt;line with two origins&lt;/a&gt;
provides a hint. What we do is take &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(|K|\)&lt;/span&gt; copies of the space &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M\)&lt;/span&gt;, and if &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x \neq x_0\)&lt;/span&gt;, we identify
all of those &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt;'s, otherwise we do nothing. It's not too hard to check that this defines a sheaf
over &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M\)&lt;/span&gt; (the local homeomorphism property is the hardest to check, and relies on the fact that
points are closed in Hausdorff spaces). In fact, if &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M = \mathbb{R}\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(K = \mathbb{Z}/2\)&lt;/span&gt;, then
then skyscraper sheaf at &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(0\)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the line with two origins. The reason this is called the
skyscraper sheaf is because only the stalk at &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x_0\)&lt;/span&gt; is tall, the stalks everywhere are flat, which
makes it look like a tall structure in an otherwise flat featureless landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're really interested in is a variant of a skyscraper sheaf with two skyscrapers, i.e. the stalks
at points &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x_0\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x_1\)&lt;/span&gt; are &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(K\)&lt;/span&gt;, and otherwise &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(0\)&lt;/span&gt;. The topology on this sheaf can be defined
analogously. We'll come back to this example once we've defined sheaf cohomology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The category of sheaves of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(K\)&lt;/span&gt;-modules over a space&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like in the case of a vector bundles over a manifold &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M\)&lt;/span&gt;, where the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; kind of map between
vector bundles is a smooth map that is a linear map on each fibre, the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; kind of map between
two sheaves &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{S}_1\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{S}_2\)&lt;/span&gt; on a space &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M\)&lt;/span&gt; is a continuous map &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f\)&lt;/span&gt; such that it
satisfies the following properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\pi = \pi \circ f\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f\)&lt;/span&gt; restricted to any any stalk &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{O}_x\)&lt;/span&gt; is a &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(K\)&lt;/span&gt;-module homomorphism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixing a space &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M\)&lt;/span&gt;, we get the category of sheaves of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(K\)&lt;/span&gt;-modules over &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M\)&lt;/span&gt;, whose objects are
sheaves, and the morphisms are what we just defined, called sheaf homomorphisms. It follows from the
fact that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\pi\)&lt;/span&gt; is a local homeomorphism that even sheaf homomorphisms are local homeomorphisms.
This category turns out to be especially nice, sharing many characteristics with the category of
abelian groups and more generally, the category of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(K\)&lt;/span&gt;-modules, such as maps possessing kernels and
cokernels, and possessing a version of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism_theorems#First_isomorphism_theorem"&gt;First Isomorphism
Theorem&lt;/a&gt;.  This sort
of category is called an abelian category, and this category is the appropriate category to do
homological algebra in. Coming back to sheaves, the kernel of a sheaf homomorphism &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f: \mathcal{S}_1
\to \mathcal{S}_2\)&lt;/span&gt; is the set of all points which map to the zero element in the stalk. With a
little bit of work, we can show the image of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f\)&lt;/span&gt; is a sheaf in its own right, and subsheaf of
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{S}_2\)&lt;/span&gt;, just like the kernel of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f\)&lt;/span&gt; is a subsheaf of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{S}_1\)&lt;/span&gt; (the definition of a
subsheaf is the most obvious one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all these definitions in hand, we can talk about exact sequences of sheaves. Consider a
sequence of sheaves and sheaf homomorphisms of the following kind.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$\cdots \xrightarrow{d_{i-2}}
\mathcal{S}_{i-1} \xrightarrow{d_{i-1}} \mathcal{S}_{i} \xrightarrow{d_{i}} \mathcal{S}_{i+1}
\xrightarrow{d_{i+1}} \cdots$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; This sequence is exact if &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathrm{ker}(d_{i}) =
\mathrm{im}(d_{i-1})\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next thing we look at is the functor &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma\)&lt;/span&gt; from the category of sheaves of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(K\)&lt;/span&gt;-modules over
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M\)&lt;/span&gt; to the category of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(K\)&lt;/span&gt;-modules. For each sheaf &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{S}\)&lt;/span&gt;, the object &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma(\mathcal{S})\)&lt;/span&gt;
is the module of sections of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{S}\)&lt;/span&gt;. A section of a sheaf &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{S}\)&lt;/span&gt; is a map &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(s: M \to
\mathcal{S}\)&lt;/span&gt; such that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\pi \circ s = \mathrm{id}\)&lt;/span&gt;. Clearly, we can add two sections, and we can
also multiply them by a scalar; we therefore have a &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(K\)&lt;/span&gt;-module. The functor &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma\)&lt;/span&gt; acts on
morphisms by composing them with the section map, i.e. &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma(f) = f \circ s\)&lt;/span&gt;. The important
question to ask here is whether the functor &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma\)&lt;/span&gt; is exact, i.e. does it short exact sequences to
short exact sequences. The answer is no. Consider the following short exact sequence.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$0
\rightarrow \mathcal{S}_1 \xrightarrow{\alpha} \mathcal{S}_2\xrightarrow{\beta} \mathcal{S}_3
\rightarrow 0 \tag{1}$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; If we apply the functor &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma\)&lt;/span&gt; to the sequence, we get something that is
not completely exact.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$0 \rightarrow \Gamma(\mathcal{S}_1) \xrightarrow{\Gamma(\alpha)}
\Gamma(\mathcal{S}_2) \xrightarrow{\Gamma(\beta)} \Gamma(\mathcal{S}_3) \rightarrow 0 \tag{2}$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; This
sequence is exact only exact at &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma(\mathcal{S}_1)\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma(\mathcal{S}_2)\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose some &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(s \in \Gamma(\mathcal{S}_1)\)&lt;/span&gt; maps to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(0\)&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma(\mathcal{S}_2)\)&lt;/span&gt;. That tells us
that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma(\alpha)(s) = 0\)&lt;/span&gt;. But that by definition means that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\alpha \circ s = 0\)&lt;/span&gt;. But &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\alpha\)&lt;/span&gt;
is injective, which means &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(s = 0\)&lt;/span&gt;. This shows exactness at &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma(\mathcal{S}_1)\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Showing exactness at &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma(\mathcal{S}_2)\)&lt;/span&gt; is a little more involved. Consider an element &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(s \in
\Gamma(\mathcal{S}_2)\)&lt;/span&gt; which gets mapped to the zero section in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma(\mathcal{S}_3)\)&lt;/span&gt;. That means
for all &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(m \in M\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\beta(s(m)) = 0\)&lt;/span&gt;.  By exactness at &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{S}_2\)&lt;/span&gt;, we can find for each &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(m\)&lt;/span&gt;, an
element &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(s'(m)\)&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{S}_1\)&lt;/span&gt; such that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\alpha(s'(m)) = s(m)\)&lt;/span&gt;.  Furthermore, because the
original short exact sequence is exact at &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{S}_1\)&lt;/span&gt;, the element &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(s'(m)\)&lt;/span&gt; is uniquely defined
(this is where the argument fails to work for &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma(\mathcal{S}_3)\)&lt;/span&gt;). All we need to show now is
that the map &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(m \mapsto s'(m)\)&lt;/span&gt; is a continuous map. This is where we use the fact that sheaf
homomorphisms are local homeomorphisms. For any &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(m\)&lt;/span&gt;, pick a small enough neighbourhood &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(U\)&lt;/span&gt; around
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(s'(m)\)&lt;/span&gt; such that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\alpha\)&lt;/span&gt; is a local homeomorphism on &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(U\)&lt;/span&gt;. Then &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(s'^{-1}(U)\)&lt;/span&gt; is given by
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(s^{-1}(\alpha(U))\)&lt;/span&gt;, which is open since &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(s\)&lt;/span&gt; is a continuous section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that the exactness of sequence &lt;span class="math"&gt;\((1)\)&lt;/span&gt; is a purely local property; it suffices to check whether
the sequence on each stalk is exact. On the other hand, showing exactness at &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma(\mathcal{S}_3)\)&lt;/span&gt;
would be a global property. This is because given any section &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(s \in \Gamma(\mathcal{S}_3)\)&lt;/span&gt;, the
best we can do is construct sections &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(s_U\)&lt;/span&gt; on open subsets &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(U\)&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M\)&lt;/span&gt;. It might so happen that these
sections defined on different subsets of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M\)&lt;/span&gt; cannot be patched together consistently to get a
continuous section. The cohomology of the sheaf will measure how badly the functor &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma\)&lt;/span&gt; fails to
be exact; to be more precise, the cohomology will tell us how extend sequence &lt;span class="math"&gt;\((2)\)&lt;/span&gt; to get an exact
sequence. We'll leave the precise details of this for a later post, and satisfy ourselves with an
example of when exactness fails to happen at &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma(\mathcal{S}_3)\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To show this, we will exhibit a surjective sheaf homomorphism &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f\)&lt;/span&gt; such that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma(f)\)&lt;/span&gt; is not a
surjective module map. Consider a connected space &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M\)&lt;/span&gt;, and let &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{S}_1\)&lt;/span&gt; be the constant sheaf
on &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M\)&lt;/span&gt;. Recall that this means &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{S}_1\)&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M \times K\)&lt;/span&gt;, with the discrete topology on
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(K\)&lt;/span&gt;. Let &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{S}_2\)&lt;/span&gt; be the skyscraper sheaf on &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M\)&lt;/span&gt; with two skyscrapers, which means the stalk
is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(K\)&lt;/span&gt; at points &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x_0\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x_1\)&lt;/span&gt; and zero otherwise.  On the stalk at point which is not &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x_0\)&lt;/span&gt; or
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x_1\)&lt;/span&gt;, the homomorphism is obviously the zero homomorphism. On the stalk at &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x_0\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x_1\)&lt;/span&gt;, we let
the homomorphism be the identity homomorphism. It's clear that this sheaf homomorphism, call it &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f\)&lt;/span&gt;
is surjective. But observe that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma(\mathcal{S}_1) = K\)&lt;/span&gt;. That's because we picked &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M\)&lt;/span&gt; to be a
connected manifold, which means the section must the constant section. On the other hand,
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma(\mathcal{S}_2) = K \oplus K\)&lt;/span&gt;, since the section can take any value independently at &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x_0\)&lt;/span&gt;
and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x_1\)&lt;/span&gt;. Which means &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma(f)\)&lt;/span&gt; is a map from &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(K\)&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(K \oplus K\)&lt;/span&gt;, which cannot be surjective in
general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tells us that exactness at &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Gamma(\mathcal{S}_3)\)&lt;/span&gt; is a global property, and the cohomology
measures (in a loose sense) how the local property of exactness of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\((1)\)&lt;/span&gt; fails to translate to
exactness of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\((2)\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADDENDUM: I will add links to similar expositions whenever I find them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Čech cohomology and the Mittag-Leffler problem: The Čech cohomology determines
whether meromorphic functions defined on small open sets can be patched together to
get a globally defined meromorphic function satisfying certain properties.
