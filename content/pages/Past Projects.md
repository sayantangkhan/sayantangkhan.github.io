### Homotopy Theory and $L^2$-invariants (Summer 2017)
 In the summer of 2017, I was a summer student at the University of MÃ¼nster, and I
 took courses in Homotopy Theory and Homological Algebra. I also participated in a
 seminar on $L^2$-invariants.

In particular, I worked out the $L^2$-Betti numbers of certain amenable spaces, and
 read a few other results. I also learnt a fair amount of homotopy theory, and wrote
up a few of the more [technical results](pdfs/articles/technical_results.pdf).

### Fourier Analysis (Summer 2016)
 In the summer of 2016, I did a reading project on Fourier Analysis and its
 applications under Prof. [Manjunath Krishnapur](http://math.iisc.ac.in/~manju/).

I read a proof for Weyl's equidistribution theorem for quadratic
polynomials with irrational coefficients, and I wrote up the following
 [expository article](pdfs/articles/weyls.pdf)
 on the proof of the theorem. I also read a proof of Roth's theorem which
states that a sufficiently large susbet of the natural numbers will contain three
term arithmetic progression. Here's the 
[expository article](pdfs/articles/roths.pdf)
 I wrote up after 
understanding the proof.

### ProvingGround (Summer 2015)

In the summer of 2015, I worked with Prof. 
[Siddhartha Gadgil](http://math.iisc.ac.in/~gadgil/)
 on his automated theorem prover [ProvingGround](https://github.com/siddhartha-gadgil/ProvingGround).

I also learnt a little bit of combinatorial group theory on my own to understand the Andrews Curtis conjucture, which naturally led to algebraic topology
