##Mathematical Experience {#mathematical-experience .unnumbered}
###Bachelor’s Thesis Project {#sec:bach-thes-proj .unnumbered}

-   **Hodge theory of Riemannian manifolds:**
    The initial part of this project involved the study of the basics of
    differential and Riemannian geometry. I studied the books
    *Introduction to Smooth Manifolds* by John M. Lee, and *Foundations
    of Differentiable Manifolds and Lie Groups* by Frank Warner. This
    project is currently underway at Indian Institute of Science, under
    the mentorship of Dr. Harish Seshadri.

###Summer Projects {#summer-projects .unnumbered}

-   **Results on homotopy groups of some spaces and spectra:**
    Study of proofs of various results in classical homotopy theory,
    including homotopy excision theorem, Brown representability theorem,
    and how unoriented cobordism theory is represented by the Thom
    spectrum. This study was done in University of Münster, based on a
    series of lectures by Prof. Dr. Michael Joachim.

-   **Computing $L^2$ Betti numbers of some simple spaces:**
    This was as a part of a seminar on $L^2$-invariants organzied
    by Prof. Dr. Arthur Bartels at the University of Münster.

-   **Fourier analysis and applications to number theory:**
    Study of some classical results in Fourier analysis, and Fourier
    analytic proofs of Weyl’s equidistribution theorem for linear and
    quadratic polynomials, and Roth’s theorem on three-term
    arithmetic progressions. This project was done under the mentoring
    of Dr. Manjunath Krishnapur at Indian Institute of Science.

-   **Automated Theorem Proving and Homotopy Type Theory:**
    Contribution to the ProvingGround project
    ([link](https://github.com/siddhartha-gadgil/ProvingGround)), which
    aims to automate and assist theorem proving under the foundations of
    Homotopy Type Theory. This project also involved learning some
    combinatorial group theory and algebraic topology. This was done
    under the mentoring of Dr. Siddhartha Gadgil, at the Indian
    Institute of Science.
