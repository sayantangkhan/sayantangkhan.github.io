 I am Sayantan Khan, an undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Sciece,
 majoring in Mathematics. This website contains some things I occasionally
 write about, along with details of some of my
 past work, both in pure mathematics, as well as other areas.

### Timeline
Here's a short description of some of the places I've been at since 2014.

attending the [Geometry, Groups and
Dynamics](https://www.icts.res.in/program/ggd2017) program.
- **May - July 2017:** I was at University of MÃ¼nster's Mathematics Department
as a DAAD-WISE Fellow.
- **January 2017:** I was at Chinese University of Hong Kong, attending the
[ITCSC-INC Winter School](http://www.itcsc.cuhk.edu.hk/Winter_School/Winter_School_2017/index.html).
- **July 2016:** I was at National Centre for Biological Sciences, attending

### Quick links

These are some articles and notes I have written in the past which I'm too lazy to
rewrite on my blog.

- [Notes](pdfs/ggd_notes/spherical_geometry.pdf) on spherical geometry I took
at GGD 2017.
- [Article](pdfs/articles/technical_results.pdf) containing some 
  technical results in homotopy theory.
- [Article](pdfs/articles/weyls.pdf) on Weyl's equidistribution theorem.
- [Article](pdfs/articles/roths.pdf) on Roth's theorem on existence of
  three-term arithmetic progressions in positive density subsets of natural
  numbers.
