Sun 05 January 2020

by <a class="url fn" href="/author/sayantan-khan.html">Sayantan Khan</a>
 


 
        </div>
        
        <div><p>In the <a href="/orbit-points-1.0.html">previous post</a>, we saw how to get an asymptotic
count of orbit points under a lattice action, i.e. a finite covolume Fuchsian group. To do so, we needed the
fact that the geodesic flow on the associated quotient was mixing with respect to the Liouville
measure. That suggests that if we want to get asymptotic counting for the orbit of an infinite
covolume Fuchsian group, we might want to show mixing of the geodesic flow for the associated
quotient space. However, proving mixing with respect to the Liouville measure is pointless, since
the Liouville measure is infinite. What we need therefore, is a some other measure on the unit tangent
bundle that is invariant under and mixing with respect to the geodesic flow.</p>
<p>For a class of Fuchsian groups known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_finiteness">geometrically finite
groups</a>, such a measure does exist: it's called
the <a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Bowen-Margulis_measure">Bowen-Margulis measure</a>. The construction
of this measure is fairly involved, and will take up several blog posts, but the intermediate constructions
are interesting in their own right. We will start off by looking at a family of measures associated to a
geometrically finite group <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span> on the limit set <span class="math">\(\Lambda(\Gamma)\)</span>, which is a subset of the boundary
<span class="math">\(\partial \mathbb{H}^2\)</span>. These measures are called the Patterson-Sullivan measures.</p>
<p>Before we describe how the Patterson-Sullivan measures on the boundary are constructed, it will be
useful to make explicit what properties we would like for them to have.  We want this measure to
respect the dimension of the limit set, at least infinitesimally. What that means is that if there's
set of radius <span class="math">\(r\)</span> which has measure <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span>, and if it's size is doubled to <span class="math">\(2r\)</span>, then it's measure
should becomes <span class="math">\(2^\delta\)</span> times the original measure, where <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> in some sense is the dimension
of the limit set. In other words, whatever measure we construct on the limit set has to be
compatible with the metric on the limit set.</p>
<p>Note however that the boundary <span class="math">\(\partial \mathbb{H}^2\)</span> (and the limit set <span class="math">\(\Lambda(\Gamma)\)</span> by extension),
doesn't have a canonical metric. Instead, it has a family of metrics, all conformal to each other,
and every one of those metrics come from a point <span class="math">\(x \in \mathbb{H}^2\)</span>. The metric associated to each point
<span class="math">\(x\)</span> comes from the identification of the unit tangent sphere at that point to the boundary. Suppose
we did have a family of measures <span class="math">\(\mu_x\)</span> one for each point, that satisfied the scaling
property. That would then mean that for any two points <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\mu_x\)</span> was absolutely
continuous with respect to <span class="math">\(\mu_y\)</span> (and the other way round), and the Radon-Nikodym derivative
<span class="math">\(\frac{d\mu_y}{d\mu_x}\)</span> would be
<span class="math">\(\left( \frac{g_y}{g_x} \right)^{\delta}\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(g_y\)</span> and <span class="math">\(g_x\)</span> are the associated
metrics. For negatively curved spaces, the ratio <span class="math">\(\left( \frac{g_y}{g_x} \right)\)</span>
at a point <span class="math">\(\xi\)</span> in the boundary is actually the Busemann function <span class="math">\(e^{\beta_{\xi}(y,x)}\)</span>. This lets us
define what we want our family of measures to be in a more precise manner.</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: A conformal density of dimension <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> on
  <span class="math">\(\partial \mathbb{H}^2\)</span> is a family of Radon measures <span class="math">\(\{\mu_x\}_{x \in \mathbb{H}^2}\)</span> such that all of them lie in
  the same measure class, and their Radon-Nikodym derivatives satisfy the following property.
  </p>
<div class="math">\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:1}
    \frac{d\mu_y}{d\mu_x}(\xi) = \left(e^{\beta_{\xi}(y,x)} \right)^\delta
  \end{equation}</div>
<p>Examples of conformal densities aren't too hard to construct. For instance, the Hausdorff <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span>
measure on the limit set <span class="math">\(\Lambda(\Gamma)\)</span> is a conformal density of dimension <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span>, where
<span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> is the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set. However, this is not the only property we want
our family of measures to satisfy. We want this family of measures to also capture which part
of the boundary do the orbit points go to. That means our family of measures should be equivariant
with respect to the <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span> action, i.e. the pushforward of <span class="math">\(\mu_x\)</span> under <span class="math">\(\gamma \in \Gamma\)</span> should be
the same as the measure <span class="math">\(\mu_{\gamma x}\)</span>. If a conformal density satisfies this property, we say that
conformal density is invariant under <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: A conformal density <span class="math">\(\{\mu_x\}_{x \in \mathbb{H}^2}\)</span> is said to be <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span>-invariant if
  the following identity holds for all <span class="math">\(x \in \mathbb{H}^2\)</span>, and all <span class="math">\(\gamma \in \Gamma\)</span>.
  </p>
<div class="math">\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:2}
  \gamma_{\ast} \mu_x = \mu_{\gamma x}
  \end{equation}</div>
<p>
  Furthermore, we will also assume
  that all these measures are supported on <span class="math">\(\Lambda(\Gamma)\)</span>.</p>
<p>It turns the definition of <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span>-invariant conformal density is restrictive enough to let us
deduce many properties of the measure without actually explicitly working with such a measure. For
instance, one can deduce from the definition that such a family of measures is quasi-ergodic with
respect to the <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span> action on <span class="math">\(\partial \mathbb{H}^2\)</span>. However, before we start proving such results,
we should verify that <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span>-invariant conformal densities actually exist, otherwise, any theorem
we prove about <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span>-invariant conformal densities will have no content.</p>
<p>The construction we will show first appeared in a paper by S.J. Patterson<sup id="fnref:paper1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:paper1">1</a></sup>, and was
later generalized to all hyperbolic spaces in by Dennis Sullivan<sup id="fnref:paper2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:paper2">2</a></sup>.
The idea behind the construction of the Patterson-Sullivan measures is quite clever (and hard to
come up with), but easy to understand. One starts off with a family of measures <span class="math">\(\mu_{x}^s\)</span>, for
every <span class="math">\(x \in \mathbb{H}^2\)</span>, and where <span class="math">\(s\)</span> is some large enough real number that makes the infinite sum
converge (assuming it exists).
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{equation}
  \mu_x^s = \frac{\sum_{\gamma \in \Gamma} e^{-s \cdot d(x, \gamma x)} \delta_{\gamma x_0} }{\sum_{\gamma \in \Gamma} e^{-s \cdot d(x, \gamma x)} }
\end{equation}</div>
<p>
For large enough <span class="math">\(s\)</span>, the infinite series in the denominator converges, giving us a probability
measure on <span class="math">\(\mathbb{H}^2\)</span> (and not <span class="math">\(\partial \mathbb{H}^2\)</span>).  Also, it turns out that this choice of
normalization isn't quite right: the family <span class="math">\(\{\mu_{x}^s\}_{x \in \mathbb{H}^2}\)</span> doesn't quite transform
like \eqref{eq:1} and \eqref{eq:2}, but it's close. The correct normalization as it turns out, comes
from picking a fixed point <span class="math">\(x_0 \in \mathbb{H}^2\)</span>, and modifying <span class="math">\(\mu_x^s\)</span> in the following manner.
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{equation}
  \mu_x^s = \frac{\sum_{\gamma \in \Gamma} e^{-s \cdot d(x, \gamma x_0)} \delta_{\gamma x} }{\sum_{\gamma \in \Gamma} e^{-s \cdot d(x_0, \gamma x_0)} }
\end{equation}</div>
<p>This family of measures is no longer a probability measure, unless <span class="math">\(x = x_0\)</span>, but for a fixed <span class="math">\(x\)</span>, it's still a finite
measure. In fact, the total mass of <span class="math">\(\mu_x^s\)</span> satisfies the following inequality.
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{equation}
  e^{-s \cdot d(x, x_0)} \leq \lVert{\mu_x^s}\rVert \leq e^{s \cdot d(x, x_0)}
\end{equation}</div>
<p>The next thing we do is observe that for large enough <span class="math">\(s\)</span>, the infinite sum
<span class="math">\(g(s) := \sum_{\gamma \in \Gamma} e^{-s \cdot d(x_0, \gamma x_0)}\)</span> does actually converge. The
easy way to see it is to get an asymptotic upper bound on how many points of <span class="math">\(\Gamma x_0\)</span> lie in a
ball radius <span class="math">\(r\)</span> around <span class="math">\(x_0\)</span>. An upper bound that works for us is <span class="math">\(c e^{r}\)</span>,
which means that an <span class="math">\(s \geq n-1\)</span> will make the infinite series converge.</p>
<p>On the other hand, for small enough <span class="math">\(s\)</span>, the series <span class="math">\(g(s)\)</span> will diverge. Which means there is a
critical exponent <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span>, depending on the group <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span> such for all <span class="math">\(s &gt; \delta\)</span>, <span class="math">\(g(s)\)</span>
converges, and for all <span class="math">\(s &lt; \delta\)</span>, <span class="math">\(g(s)\)</span> diverges. Suppose <span class="math">\(g(\delta)\)</span> actually diverges. Then we
could pick a sequence <span class="math">\(\{s_i\}\)</span>, going down to <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span>, and look at the sequence of measures
<span class="math">\(\mu_x^{s_i}\)</span>. Since these can be thought of as measures on <span class="math">\(\overline{\mathbb{H}^2}\)</span>, which is compact,
and the mass of all these measures is bounded by inequality <em>(5)</em>, one can pick out a
convergent subsequence. Since we assumed <span class="math">\(g(\delta)\)</span> actually diverged, the limit measure <span class="math">\(\mu_x\)</span>
will actually be supported on the limit set <span class="math">\(\Lambda(\Gamma)\)</span>, and satisfy the properties we want
it to satisfy (we will verify that).</p>
<p>This is the rough idea behind the Patterson-Sullivan construction. However, there are many questions
that one needs to answer.</p>
<ol>
<li>What does one do if <span class="math">\(g(\delta)\)</span> does not diverge?</li>
<li>How does this measure depend on the choice of <span class="math">\(\{s_i\}\)</span>?</li>
<li>Does it depend on the choice of basepoint <span class="math">\(x_0\)</span>?</li>
</ol>
<p>The first problem was dealt with by Patterson in Lemma 3.1 of his paper. The idea is
to attach additional weights to <span class="math">\(e^{-s \cdot d(x,\gamma x_0)}\)</span> by multiplying it with
<span class="math">\(h(d(x, \gamma x_0))\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(h\)</span> is a function from <span class="math">\(\mathbb{R}_+\)</span> to <span class="math">\(\mathbb{R}_+\)</span>, which grows slowly, i.e. it
makes the infinite series diverge for exponent <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span>, but still converge for larger exponents. We
also require that for any <span class="math">\(d\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\lim_{r \to \infty} \frac{h(r + d)}{h(r)} = 1\)</span>. The last
condition ensures that this modified measure transforms like the original measure in the limit.<sup id="fnref2:paper1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:paper1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The second and the third questions can be answered by proving a rather general theorem about the uniqueness
of the constructed measures.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong> (Uniqueness):   Let <span class="math">\(\{\nu_x\}_{x \in \mathbb{H}^2}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\{\mu_x\}_{x \in \mathbb{H}^2}\)</span> be two <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span>-invariant conformal densities of the same dimension
  <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\(\{\mu_x\}_{x \in \mathbb{H}^2}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\{\nu_x\}_{x \in \mathbb{H}^2}\)</span> are the same up to
  scaling.</p>
<p>This statement of the above theorem is equivalent to the following statement.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong> (Quasi-ergodicity):   Let <span class="math">\(\nu\)</span> be a <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span>-invariant conformal density. Then the <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span> action on the boundary <span class="math">\(\partial \mathbb{H}^2\)</span> is
  quasi-ergodic with respect to <span class="math">\(\nu\)</span>, i.e. any <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span>-invariant sets have full measure
  or zero measure.</p>
<p>The equivalence of these two statements is straightforward to see. Suppose one had a non-trivial
invariant set <span class="math">\(U\)</span>. One could then condition the measure on <span class="math">\(U\)</span> to get a <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span>-invariant conformal
density that wasn't a scalar multiple of the original <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span>-invariant conformal density. That
would contradict uniqueness. On the other hand, if one had two <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span>-invariant conformal
densities, their Radon-Nikodym derivative would be a <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span> invariant function, and hence constant
almost everywhere.</p>
<p>Although in principle, we can prove quasi-ergodicity using just the results we have now, the
appropriate place for its proof is the post on the ergodicity of the geodesic flow. One may worry
that in the process of doing so, its proof may become circular, i.e. it may use uniqueness. The fact
that this does not happen can be verified skipping ahead to the relevant section.<sup id="fnref:footnote3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:footnote3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Once the foundational question has been dealt with, one is faced a (relatively) more mundane
problem: how does one actually measure the Patterson-Sullivan measure of a given set, or at least,
get a good estimate. To this end, we have Sullivan's shadow lemma.  Before we state the lemma, we
need to define what a shadow is.</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong> (Shadow): For any points <span class="math">\(x\)</span> in <span class="math">\(\overline{\mathbb{H}^2}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> in <span class="math">\(\mathbb{H}^2\)</span>, and any <span class="math">\(r
  \geq 0\)</span>, the shadow <span class="math">\(\mathcal{O}_r(x, y)\)</span> is the set of all points <span class="math">\(\xi\)</span> in <span class="math">\(\partial \mathbb{H}^2\)</span> such
  that the geodesic from <span class="math">\(x\)</span> to <span class="math">\(\xi\)</span> intersects a ball of radius <span class="math">\(r\)</span> around <span class="math">\(y\)</span>.</p>

<p><strong>Lemma</strong> (Sullivan's shadow lemma):  Let <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span> be a non-elementary discrete group, and let <span class="math">\(\{\mu_x\}_{x \in \mathbb{H}^2}\)</span> be a <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span>-invariant conformal density of
  dimension <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span>. Then for any <span class="math">\(x\)</span> there exists a large enough <span class="math">\(r_0\)</span>, such that for all
  <span class="math">\(r \geq r_0\)</span>, there exists a <span class="math">\(C &gt; 0\)</span>, depending on <span class="math">\(r\)</span> for which the following inequality holds
  for all <span class="math">\(\gamma \in \Gamma\)</span>.
  </p>
<div class="math">\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{C} e^{-\delta \cdot d(x, \gamma x)} \leq \mu_{x}\left( \mathcal{O}_r(x, \gamma x) \right) \leq  C e^{-\delta \cdot d(x, \gamma x)}
  \end{equation}</div>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>:   The first thing we need to show is that there exists an <span class="math">\(r\)</span> large enough, and an <span class="math">\(\varepsilon\)</span> small
  enough such that the following inequality holds for all <span class="math">\(y \in \overline{\Omega}\)</span>.
  </p>
<div class="math">\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:5}
    1 \geq \mu_x\left( \mathcal{O}_r(y, x) \right) \geq \varepsilon
  \end{equation}</div>
<p>
  As <span class="math">\(r\)</span> gets larger, the set <span class="math">\( \mathcal{O}_r(y, x)\)</span> gets larger as well, and contains everything
  but the endpoint of the geodesic from <span class="math">\(x\)</span> to <span class="math">\(y\)</span>. That means the only way this inequality can fail
  to hold is if all the mass of <span class="math">\(\mu_x\)</span> was concentrated at that point. But since <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span> is
  non-elementary, the measure <span class="math">\(\mu_x\)</span> cannot be supported on a single point.</p>
<table class="image">

<p>We now rewrite <span class="math">\(\mu_x\left( \mathcal{O}_r(x, \gamma x) \right)\)</span> using identities \eqref{eq:1} and \eqref{eq:2}.
  </p>
<div class="math">\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:6}
    \mu_x\left( \mathcal{O}_r(x, \gamma x) \right) = \int_{\mathcal{O}_r(\gamma^{-1}x, x)} e^{-\delta \cdot \beta_{\xi}(\gamma^{-1}x, x)} d\mu_x(\xi)
  \end{equation}</div>
<p>
  Since we already know <span class="math">\( \mu_x\left( \mathcal{O}_r(\gamma^{-1}x, x) \right)\)</span> is between <span class="math">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\varepsilon\)</span>,
  all we need to do is estimate the Busemann function on the shadow. We can do that using the triangle
  inequality, which gives us the following inequality.
  </p>
<div class="math">\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:7}
    d(\gamma^{-1}x, x) - 2r \leq \beta_{\xi}(\gamma^{-1}x, x) \leq d(\gamma^{-1}x, x)
  \end{equation}</div>
<p>
  Combining \eqref{eq:5}, \eqref{eq:6}, and \eqref{eq:7}, we get the inequality we need. <span class="math">\(\square\)</span></p>
<p>All this may seem like it has noting to do with counting, but in fact, we already have developed enough tools
to get a rough asymptotic count of the orbit points for convex cocompact groups, but that will have to wait for
the next post because I think this post is long enough already.</p>
