                This is the personal website of Sayantan Khan, i.e. me. I am an undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Sciece,
                majoring in Mathematics. This website contains details of the courses I've taken, my past projects, both in pure
                mathematics, as well as other areas.
            </p>

                You can have a look at my past projects, presentations, and courses by clicking on the relevant link on the
                navigation bar. The navigation bar also has links to my CV, my Github profile, and a page describing my
                other activities, which include tinkering around with open source software, and Linux in particular,
                and long distance cycling.
