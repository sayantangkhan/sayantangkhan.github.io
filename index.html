        </div>
        
        <div><h2>Motivation for cohomology</h2>
<p>In most introductory algebraic topology courses, cohomology is rather poorly motivated. It's most
commonly seen form in an algebraic topology course is singular cohomology, which arises as a the
homology of the dual of the singular chain complex, but that doesn't really tell you why it's of any
more interest than singular homology, aside from the fact that you get an additional cup product
which you did not have before. However, this approach obscures the geometric meaning of cohomology.</p>
<p>A much more intuitive introduction to cohomology turns out to be De Rham cohomology, often
encountered in introductory differential geometry courses. Loosely speaking, De Rham cohomology
measures in how many different ways can a closed form fail to be exact.</p>
<p>Another cohomology theory we'll look at is sheaf cohomology. Loosely, the cohomology of a sheaf
measures how a certain functor <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span>, which we'll define later fails to be an exact functor.</p>
<p>In the case of De Rham cohomology, we'll interpret the form being closed as a local property, and it
being exact a global property, and the the case of sheaf cohomology, the exactness of the following
sequence (the exact details of which we'll see in a later section) as a local property.  </p>
<div class="math">$$0
\rightarrow \mathcal{S}_1 \rightarrow \mathcal{S}_2\rightarrow \mathcal{S}_3 \rightarrow 0$$</div>
<p> The
exactness of the sequence we get by applying <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span> to the above sequence turns out to be a global
property.</p>
<p>In both the cases, the cohomology measures how the local property fails to translate to the global
one.</p>
<h2>De Rham Cohomology</h2>
<p>The De Rham cohomology of a manifold <span class="math">\(M\)</span> (of dimension <span class="math">\(m\)</span>) is the homology of the following of the
following cochain sequence.  </p>
<div class="math">$$0 \xrightarrow{d} \Lambda^0(M) \xrightarrow{d} \Lambda^1(M)
\xrightarrow{d} \cdots \xrightarrow{d} \Lambda^m(M) \xrightarrow{d} 0$$</div>
<p> Here, <span class="math">\(\Lambda^k(M)\)</span> is the
space of <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-forms on <span class="math">\(M\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(d\)</span> is the exterior derivative operator.  For a <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-form <span class="math">\(\omega\)</span> to
be closed, <span class="math">\(d\omega\)</span> must be <span class="math">\(0\)</span>. This is a local property, in the sense that <span class="math">\(d\omega\)</span> evaluated at
any point <span class="math">\(p \in M\)</span> depends only on the value of <span class="math">\(\omega\)</span> on any small neighbourhood of <span class="math">\(p\)</span>.  In
fact, one can say a little more, and claim that <span class="math">\(d\omega(p)\)</span> depends only on the <em>germ</em> of <span class="math">\(\omega\)</span>
at <span class="math">\(p\)</span>.  If we pick a Euclidean neighbourhood <span class="math">\(U\)</span> of <span class="math">\(p\)</span> which is homeomorphic to the open unit
ball, the Poincar√© lemma tells us that there is some <span class="math">\((k+1)\)</span>-form <span class="math">\(\eta\)</span> defined on <span class="math">\(U\)</span> such that
<span class="math">\(\omega = d\eta\)</span>. In other words, the closed form <span class="math">\(\omega\)</span> is locally exact.</p>
<p>The De Rham cohomology class of <span class="math">\(\omega\)</span> measures how badly does the property of local exactness
fail to translate to global exactness. We can write <span class="math">\(\omega\)</span> as <span class="math">\(\gamma + d\zeta\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span> is
the canonical representative of the cohomology class of <span class="math">\(\omega\)</span> (more on this in later posts), and
<span class="math">\(\zeta\)</span> is a <span class="math">\((k-1)\)</span>-form. If we stretch the analogy a bit, we can say <span class="math">\(\omega\)</span> misses being
globally exact by <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span> amount. This is the first example of how cohomology measures how badly a
local property fails to be global.</p>
<h2>Sheaf Cohomology</h2>
<p>Before we see what sort of local to global failure sheaf cohomology measures, we'll quickly define
sheaves and sheaf cohomology, and look at one example.</p>
<h3>Quick introduction to sheaves</h3>
<p>Given a manifold <span class="math">\(M\)</span> (whatever we discuss will hold in for Hausdorff spaces, and with a little more
work, can be made to work even for a larger class of spaces like spectra of rings), a sheaf
<span class="math">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> of <span class="math">\(K\)</span>-modules (<span class="math">\(K\)</span> is always assumed to be a commutative ring with identity) over <span class="math">\(M\)</span>
is a topological space <span class="math">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> with a surjective map <span class="math">\(\pi: \mathcal{S} \to M\)</span>, such that the
following properties are satisfied.</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="math">\(\pi\)</span> is a local homeomorphism, i.e. for any point <span class="math">\(s \in \mathcal{S}\)</span>, there's a neighbourhood
of <span class="math">\(s\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(\pi\)</span> restricted to that neighbourhood is a homeomorphism.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\pi^{-1}(x)\)</span>, which we'll denote by <span class="math">\(\mathcal{O}_x\)</span>, is a <span class="math">\(K\)</span>-module, for all <span class="math">\(x \in
M\)</span>. <span class="math">\(\mathcal{O}_x\)</span> is called the stalk of <span class="math">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> at <span class="math">\(x\)</span>.</li>
<li>The module operations on the stalk are continuous, i.e. if we look at the stalk with the subspace
topology, the module operations of addition and scalar multiplication are continuous.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sheaves in some sense a modules parametrized by the space <span class="math">\(M\)</span>, like vector bundles, but vector
bundles do not satisfy the first condition, unlike sheaves.  The simplest example of a sheaf is the
<em>constant sheaf</em> which is just <span class="math">\(M \times V\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(V\)</span> is a <span class="math">\(K\)</span>-module with the discrete topology.</p>
<p>Another important example is the sheaf of germs of <span class="math">\(C^{\infty}\)</span> functions on a manifold <span class="math">\(M\)</span>. For
each <span class="math">\(x \in M\)</span>, a point in <span class="math">\(\mathcal{O}_x\)</span> is an equivalence class of functions, the equivalence
relation being that <span class="math">\(f \sim g\)</span> if <span class="math">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math">\(g\)</span> agree on some neighbourhood of <span class="math">\(x\)</span>. This sheaf
deserves a post of its own, and I shall write about it in the future.</p>
<p>The last example, which will be key to our goal, is the <em>skyscraper sheaf</em>. We'll describe it by
first describing the stalk at each point, and then putting an appropriate topology on it. Fix a
point <span class="math">\(x_0 \in M\)</span>.  The stalk <span class="math">\(\mathcal{O}_{x_0}\)</span> at <span class="math">\(x_0\)</span> will be <span class="math">\(K\)</span> as a module over itself. The
stalk at every other point is the zero module. As a set, our sheaf is the following.  </p>
<div class="math">$$\mathcal{S}
= K \sqcup \bigsqcup_{x \neq x_0} \{0\}$$</div>
<p> The question is what topology do we put on this space. The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Hausdorff_manifold#Line_with_two_origins">line with two origins</a>
provides a hint. What we do is take <span class="math">\(|K|\)</span> copies of the space <span class="math">\(M\)</span>, and if <span class="math">\(x \neq x_0\)</span>, we identify
all of those <span class="math">\(x\)</span>'s, otherwise we do nothing. It's not too hard to check that this defines a sheaf
over <span class="math">\(M\)</span> (the local homeomorphism property is the hardest to check, and relies on the fact that
points are closed in Hausdorff spaces). In fact, if <span class="math">\(M = \mathbb{R}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(K = \mathbb{Z}/2\)</span>, then
then skyscraper sheaf at <span class="math">\(0\)</span> <em>is</em> the line with two origins. The reason this is called the
skyscraper sheaf is because only the stalk at <span class="math">\(x_0\)</span> is tall, the stalks everywhere are flat, which
makes it look like a tall structure in an otherwise flat featureless landscape.</p>
<p>We're really interested in is a variant of a skyscraper sheaf with two skyscrapers, i.e. the stalks
at points <span class="math">\(x_0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(x_1\)</span> are <span class="math">\(K\)</span>, and otherwise <span class="math">\(0\)</span>. The topology on this sheaf can be defined
analogously. We'll come back to this example once we've defined sheaf cohomology.</p>
<h3>The category of sheaves of <span class="math">\(K\)</span>-modules over a space</h3>
<p>Just like in the case of a vector bundles over a manifold <span class="math">\(M\)</span>, where the <em>right</em> kind of map between
vector bundles is a smooth map that is a linear map on each fibre, the <em>right</em> kind of map between
two sheaves <span class="math">\(\mathcal{S}_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\mathcal{S}_2\)</span> on a space <span class="math">\(M\)</span> is a continuous map <span class="math">\(f\)</span> such that it
satisfies the following properties.</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="math">\(\pi = \pi \circ f\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(f\)</span> restricted to any any stalk <span class="math">\(\mathcal{O}_x\)</span> is a <span class="math">\(K\)</span>-module homomorphism.</li>
</ol>
<p>Fixing a space <span class="math">\(M\)</span>, we get the category of sheaves of <span class="math">\(K\)</span>-modules over <span class="math">\(M\)</span>, whose objects are
sheaves, and the morphisms are what we just defined, called sheaf homomorphisms. It follows from the
fact that <span class="math">\(\pi\)</span> is a local homeomorphism that even sheaf homomorphisms are local homeomorphisms.
This category turns out to be especially nice, sharing many characteristics with the category of
abelian groups and more generally, the category of <span class="math">\(K\)</span>-modules, such as maps possessing kernels and
cokernels, and possessing a version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism_theorems#First_isomorphism_theorem">First Isomorphism
Theorem</a>.  This sort
of category is called an abelian category, and this category is the appropriate category to do
homological algebra in. Coming back to sheaves, the kernel of a sheaf homomorphism <span class="math">\(f: \mathcal{S}_1
\to \mathcal{S}_2\)</span> is the set of all points which map to the zero element in the stalk. With a
little bit of work, we can show the image of <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is a sheaf in its own right, and subsheaf of
<span class="math">\(\mathcal{S}_2\)</span>, just like the kernel of <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is a subsheaf of <span class="math">\(\mathcal{S}_1\)</span> (the definition of a
subsheaf is the most obvious one).</p>
<p>With all these definitions in hand, we can talk about exact sequences of sheaves. Consider a
sequence of sheaves and sheaf homomorphisms of the following kind.  </p>
<div class="math">$$\cdots \xrightarrow{d_{i-2}}
\mathcal{S}_{i-1} \xrightarrow{d_{i-1}} \mathcal{S}_{i} \xrightarrow{d_{i}} \mathcal{S}_{i+1}
\xrightarrow{d_{i+1}} \cdots$$</div>
<p> This sequence is exact if <span class="math">\(\mathrm{ker}(d_{i}) =
\mathrm{im}(d_{i-1})\)</span>.</p>
<p>The next thing we look at is the functor <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span> from the category of sheaves of <span class="math">\(K\)</span>-modules over
<span class="math">\(M\)</span> to the category of <span class="math">\(K\)</span>-modules. For each sheaf <span class="math">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span>, the object <span class="math">\(\Gamma(\mathcal{S})\)</span>
is the module of sections of <span class="math">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span>. A section of a sheaf <span class="math">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> is a map <span class="math">\(s: M \to
\mathcal{S}\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(\pi \circ s = \mathrm{id}\)</span>. Clearly, we can add two sections, and we can
also multiply them by a scalar; we therefore have a <span class="math">\(K\)</span>-module. The functor <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span> acts on
morphisms by composing them with the section map, i.e. <span class="math">\(\Gamma(f) = f \circ s\)</span>. The important
question to ask here is whether the functor <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span> is exact, i.e. does it short exact sequences to
short exact sequences. The answer is no. Consider the following short exact sequence.  </p>
<div class="math">$$0
\rightarrow \mathcal{S}_1 \xrightarrow{\alpha} \mathcal{S}_2\xrightarrow{\beta} \mathcal{S}_3
\rightarrow 0 \tag{1}$$</div>
<p> If we apply the functor <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span> to the sequence, we get something that is
not completely exact.  </p>
<div class="math">$$0 \rightarrow \Gamma(\mathcal{S}_1) \xrightarrow{\Gamma(\alpha)}
\Gamma(\mathcal{S}_2) \xrightarrow{\Gamma(\beta)} \Gamma(\mathcal{S}_3) \rightarrow 0 \tag{2}$$</div>
<p> This
sequence is exact only exact at <span class="math">\(\Gamma(\mathcal{S}_1)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\Gamma(\mathcal{S}_2)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Suppose some <span class="math">\(s \in \Gamma(\mathcal{S}_1)\)</span> maps to <span class="math">\(0\)</span> in <span class="math">\(\Gamma(\mathcal{S}_2)\)</span>. That tells us
that <span class="math">\(\Gamma(\alpha)(s) = 0\)</span>. But that by definition means that <span class="math">\(\alpha \circ s = 0\)</span>. But <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span>
is injective, which means <span class="math">\(s = 0\)</span>. This shows exactness at <span class="math">\(\Gamma(\mathcal{S}_1)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Showing exactness at <span class="math">\(\Gamma(\mathcal{S}_2)\)</span> is a little more involved. Consider an element <span class="math">\(s \in
\Gamma(\mathcal{S}_2)\)</span> which gets mapped to the zero section in <span class="math">\(\Gamma(\mathcal{S}_3)\)</span>. That means
for all <span class="math">\(m \in M\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\beta(s(m)) = 0\)</span>.  By exactness at <span class="math">\(\mathcal{S}_2\)</span>, we can find for each <span class="math">\(m\)</span>, an
element <span class="math">\(s'(m)\)</span> of <span class="math">\(\mathcal{S}_1\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(\alpha(s'(m)) = s(m)\)</span>.  Furthermore, because the
original short exact sequence is exact at <span class="math">\(\mathcal{S}_1\)</span>, the element <span class="math">\(s'(m)\)</span> is uniquely defined
(this is where the argument fails to work for <span class="math">\(\Gamma(\mathcal{S}_3)\)</span>). All we need to show now is
that the map <span class="math">\(m \mapsto s'(m)\)</span> is a continuous map. This is where we use the fact that sheaf
homomorphisms are local homeomorphisms. For any <span class="math">\(m\)</span>, pick a small enough neighbourhood <span class="math">\(U\)</span> around
<span class="math">\(s'(m)\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> is a local homeomorphism on <span class="math">\(U\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\(s'^{-1}(U)\)</span> is given by
<span class="math">\(s^{-1}(\alpha(U))\)</span>, which is open since <span class="math">\(s\)</span> is a continuous section.</p>
<p>Notice that the exactness of sequence <span class="math">\((1)\)</span> is a purely local property; it suffices to check whether
the sequence on each stalk is exact. On the other hand, showing exactness at <span class="math">\(\Gamma(\mathcal{S}_3)\)</span>
would be a global property. This is because given any section <span class="math">\(s \in \Gamma(\mathcal{S}_3)\)</span>, the
best we can do is construct sections <span class="math">\(s_U\)</span> on open subsets <span class="math">\(U\)</span> of <span class="math">\(M\)</span>. It might so happen that these
sections defined on different subsets of <span class="math">\(M\)</span> cannot be patched together consistently to get a
continuous section. The cohomology of the sheaf will measure how badly the functor <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span> fails to
be exact; to be more precise, the cohomology will tell us how extend sequence <span class="math">\((2)\)</span> to get an exact
sequence. We'll leave the precise details of this for a later post, and satisfy ourselves with an
example of when exactness fails to happen at <span class="math">\(\Gamma(\mathcal{S}_3)\)</span>.</p>
<p>To show this, we will exhibit a surjective sheaf homomorphism <span class="math">\(f\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(\Gamma(f)\)</span> is not a
surjective module map. Consider a connected space <span class="math">\(M\)</span>, and let <span class="math">\(\mathcal{S}_1\)</span> be the constant sheaf
on <span class="math">\(M\)</span>. Recall that this means <span class="math">\(\mathcal{S}_1\)</span> is <span class="math">\(M \times K\)</span>, with the discrete topology on
<span class="math">\(K\)</span>. Let <span class="math">\(\mathcal{S}_2\)</span> be the skyscraper sheaf on <span class="math">\(M\)</span> with two skyscrapers, which means the stalk
is <span class="math">\(K\)</span> at points <span class="math">\(x_0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(x_1\)</span> and zero otherwise.  On the stalk at point which is not <span class="math">\(x_0\)</span> or
<span class="math">\(x_1\)</span>, the homomorphism is obviously the zero homomorphism. On the stalk at <span class="math">\(x_0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(x_1\)</span>, we let
the homomorphism be the identity homomorphism. It's clear that this sheaf homomorphism, call it <span class="math">\(f\)</span>
is surjective. But observe that <span class="math">\(\Gamma(\mathcal{S}_1) = K\)</span>. That's because we picked <span class="math">\(M\)</span> to be a
connected manifold, which means the section must the constant section. On the other hand,
<span class="math">\(\Gamma(\mathcal{S}_2) = K \oplus K\)</span>, since the section can take any value independently at <span class="math">\(x_0\)</span>
and <span class="math">\(x_1\)</span>. Which means <span class="math">\(\Gamma(f)\)</span> is a map from <span class="math">\(K\)</span> to <span class="math">\(K \oplus K\)</span>, which cannot be surjective in
general.</p>
<p>This tells us that exactness at <span class="math">\(\Gamma(\mathcal{S}_3)\)</span> is a global property, and the cohomology
measures (in a loose sense) how the local property of exactness of <span class="math">\((1)\)</span> fails to translate to
exactness of <span class="math">\((2)\)</span>.</p>
